  "name": "Vagaro Image Editor",
  "body": " \n The  Vagaro Image Editor  is a built-in image editor to help you work with photos and other images used in your online business. You can resize, crop, flip, rotate and add text, shapes, effects, and filters. \n  \n The image editor is invoked when you add photos or images in the following areas: \nService/Class menu \nAdd or edit services (Vagaro or Custom) and service bundles \nAdd or edit classes (Vagaro or Custom) and workshops \nAdd or edit Add-Ons for all services, bundles, classes, and workshops \nInventory/Products \nAdd or edit products and product bundles \nAdd or edit images in your Venue Gallery \nImages used in Email Marketing campaigns \nAdd an image using  Upload  \nEdit an image placed using  Upload  or  Select from Gallery  \nVagaro Drive \nCustomer image files for appointments, customers, and forms. These are also accessible from the Customer's Profile - Files tab \nImage files stored in the Business files area \nHow to use Image Editor \n \n Images uploaded to forms (on the Customer Profile Forms tab) open in the Vagaro Markup Editor, but if you then want to edit them on Vagaro Drive, you can select the Image Editor to use. Most of the time, when you upload an image (for a product, for example), the uploaded image will open in the Vagaro Image Editor. If an image does not open in one of the editor options on upload, edit it after it's been uploaded. \n For example, let's add a photo to a product in our inventory. \nGo to your  Inventory Management  page, select a product and edit it. \nScroll down to the  Photos  area. \nClick +Add Image or locate and drag a file from your device to the image area. \n The image opens in the  Vagaro Image Editor . \nEdit the image using the available tools (see Image Editor Tools for an explanation of each tool) and click Save . \nIf the product already has an image associated with it, you can edit it in the Vagaro Image Editor to make changes.  \nHover over an existing image, click the  Action  menu (3 horizontal dots) and click Edit . \nEdit the image using the available tools (see Image Editor Tools for an explanation of each tool) and click Save . \nUsing the Image Editor from Vagaro Drive \n \n For images stored on Vagaro Drive, you can edit using either the  Markup Editor  or  Image Editor . You can access customer files from the  Customer Profile - Files  tab and editing images from the profile works the same as on Vagaro Drive. \n \n Note \n Editing files from the  Customer Profile SOAP  or  Forms  tabs does not open the Image Editor window. \nSelect an image file (appointment, customer, forms, or business files), click the  Action  menu (3 horizontal dots), and click Open . \nThis opens a gallery of images from the customer or file area. Scroll through if you want to pick a different image. \nClick the  Pencil  icon and select Edit using Image Editor . \nEdit the image using the available tools (see Image Editor Tools for an explanation of each tool) and click Save . \nUsing Image Editor from your Venue Gallery \n \n You can use the image editor on Venue Gallery (used for photos, images, and your logo) but not for images in your Portfolio (for showcasing services and classes.) To access the Venue Gallery, navigate to Settings → Look &amp; Feel → Photo Gallery , then select the Venue Gallery tab. \n Open an image in the image editor the same way we've shown in the other areas: hover over the image, click the  Action  menu and click Edit . \nImage Editor Tools \n \n Each  Image Editor  tool is described below. \n \n Reset \n There is a  Reset  icon on the editor screen. Until you have Saved the image after making all changes and applying all effects and filters that you want, you can click Reset to restore the image to the original. Once you save it, you must delete and reupload the image to start over by applying the editor tools. \nAdjust  \n  \n This tool gives you controls using slide switches for the image's overall brightness, contrast (image sharpness,) exposure (amount of light,) and saturation (color intensity). \n  Effects  \n  \n Choose from 8 pre-configured photo enhancements. Try each to get to know what they do to an image. The effects are named: Edge Enhance, Emboss, Grungy, Lomo, Radial Blur, Sin City, and Tilt Shift. To apply more than one effect to an image, save the image after applying one, reopen the Effects tool and apply another. \n  Filters  \n  \n Choose from 10 photo filters. Try each to get to know what they do to an image. The filters are named: Cross Process, Glow Sun, Jarques, Love, Old Boot, Orange Peel, Pin Hole, Sepia, Sun Rise, and Vintage. To apply more than one filter to an image, save the image after applying one filter, reopen the Filters tool and apply another filter. \n  Orientation  \n  \n Rotate and flip your image. You can rotate right and left in 90° increments or use the sliding scale to tilt the image by degrees. Use  Flip  to reverse the image on the horizontal or vertical axis. Click Apply to save your change and, if wanted, go back into the Orientation tool to apply further options. \n  Crop  \n  \n Remove unnecessary parts of an image by cropping. You can crop your image to preset ratios that work best for you or custom crop. The preset crop options draw a frame for you to drag on the image, which will determine how it is cropped when you click Apply . \n The Custom option has a lock icon. When active, it will constrain your cropping to be proportional to the original size and shape of the image. When off, you can crop to any size and proportions. \n To use the crop tool, use the \"handles\" around the edges and drag and drop the frame to the size you prefer. Move the frame by hovering inside it, clicking, and moving it to the position you want. (Your cursor looks like cross-hairs when you are moving the frame.) Click Apply to save your cropping changes and cancel or reset to restore the image. \n  Resize  \n  \n Change the image's overall size. As with the cropping tool, you can resize it proportionally or not. Resize the image by entering the numbers (in pixels) for width and height. There is no preview of the resize change. Click Save to finish. \n",

Vagaro will deposit the full purchase amount (minus their 6% non-refundable fee) into your bank account the next business day. \n After VPL checkout, all future payments are handled between the customer and Vagaro, so your business isn’t affected if a customer misses a payment. \n \n Important \n  Please Read Before Continuing ! \n  All VPL reactions are subject to a 6% non-refundable fee.  \n Only available for US businesses. All VPL payments will be deposited into the booth renter's or the business's merchant account after one business day. The cut-off time is 6 p.m. PST. Any transactions made with VPL after 6 p.m. will be deposited in two business days. \n  In some cases, Vagaro may reject customers from making large purchases. If a customer uses VPL for a large checkout but is not approved, the checkout may be unsuccessful. \n  If your business is concerned about transaction failures after a service is completed, please see the following article .  \n \n This article will cover the following: \nSign Up for Vagaro Pay Later (next) \nBooth Renters and Service Providers \nRefunds \nVagaro Pay Later in Reports \nDeactivate Vagaro Pay Later \nRelated Article: Checking Out using Vagaro Pay Later \nSign Up for Vagaro Pay Later \n \n You cannot activate VPL without  Credit Card Processing  . \n There are four pages in Vagaro where you can activate VPL: \nOn the Vagaro Pay Later sales page \nOn the Credit Card Processing page \nOn the Feature Subscription page \nOn the In-House Checkout page. \nAll pages have a similar sign-up process, so you can follow the steps below to activate VPL. \n \n Important \n The Vagaro Pro app and Web screens have similar steps for both versions. Follow the steps below, but keep in mind that your screen may look different. \nWeb: Navigate to Settings → Add-Ons → Vagaro Pay Later . \n  \n Vagaro Pro: Navigate to More → Settings → Add-Ons → Vagaro Pay Later . \nClick or tap Activate . \nRead and agree to VPL terms, then click or tap Save . \nThe VPL activation request has been sent. \n \n Note \n VPL acceptance may take up to two weeks for approval. \nClick or tap Send Invites to invite your customers to VPL.

The customer’s account will not be credited for the refund, or you might refund the same customer twice. Make sure you refund all VPL purchases through the Transaction List.

  "body": " \n   \n Create new revenue opportunities online by adding Vagaro Live Stream! Live streaming enables you to create online services in addition to your existing face-to-face services. Clients can book these remote services from the Vagaro App, Vagaro.com, or social media. Choose between live-streaming one-on-one sessions and live-streaming classes for multiple attendees. \n Vagaro Live Stream is fully automated and allows you to work from anywhere with ease. Once a client has booked a live stream session, they will receive an automated confirmation containing a link to join the live stream. Vagaro automatically synchronizes with the scheduled class or service on the corresponding Vagaro calendar. If you change the date and time or cancel the live stream, Vagaro will automatically update the meeting and notify all the participants. \nWhat's in this article? \n \n Follow the steps below to set up Vagaro Live Stream and learn how to use it with Services and Classes. \nActivating or Deactivating Vagaro Live Stream \nHow Many Licenses Do I Need? \nSetting up a Service with Live Streaming \nSetting up a Class or Workshop with Live Streaming \nStart Live Stream for a Service, Class, or Workshop \nLive Stream - First-Time Use \nHow do I use this? \nActivating or Deactivating Vagaro Live Stream \nNavigate to More → Settings → Add-Ons → Live Stream . \nTap Activate . \n  \n Once Vagaro Live Stream is activated, you can deactivate it from the same screen by tapping the white Deactivate button.

Remember that you can have clients book Live Stream classes and appointments directly using the Online Shopping Cart (activate for $10/mo.) \nSelect the number of concurrent streams you want to offer. \nImportant \n When you activate Vagaro Live Stream, you have one license for $10/month. Any of your employees can use a license to live stream a class or service, and any number of customers (designated by you) can view the live stream. You must buy additional licenses to allow multiple concurrent live stream sessions. Each license gives you the ability to stream an additional simultaneous session. Again, each license can be used by any of your employees with any number of viewing participants (as limited when you set up the live stream option for a class or service.) \nIf you don't have Vagaro Drive, you can add it here by selecting a storage plan. \nImportant \n Without Vagaro Drive activated, you cannot save live-streamed events for later playback to customers. \nHow Many Licenses Do I Need? \nAll your employees can use your Vagaro Live Stream licenses. You do not need to have a license for each employee. You DO, however, need a license for each live stream session that will run concurrently. You can plan for the number of streaming sessions you will want to run at once, but you can also add licenses at the same time you add a new streaming service or class. Each additional streaming license is $10/month. \n When you are adding a new streaming class or service, the system checks for any other streaming sessions scheduled for the same time. If it finds that you do not have enough licenses for the additional session, you'll see this pop-up to add licenses: \n  \n Use the +/- buttons to adjust the number and tap Save to finish. \nSetting up a Service with Live Streaming \nNavigate to More → Settings → Service/Class Menu . \nYou can edit an existing service or tap Add to create a new service and then edit it. \n \n Note \n See  Add a Service - Vagaro Pro app to learn more about adding services. \nTo enable the streaming capability, turn on the  Live Stream  toggle setting. \nWhen done editing the service, tap Save , and the service will now be offered as a live stream. \n \n Note \n Editing a service to add live streaming will only apply to future bookings. \nSetting up a Class or Workshop with Live Streaming \nTap Calendar , select an empty time slot, tap, and select New Class . \n To edit a scheduled class, tap the class and select Edit . \nTo add Live Streaming, enter the number of people who can participate in the  Live Stream Capacity  field, which activates the live stream option for this class. \nNote \n To make a class  In-House  or  Live Stream  ONLY, set a capacity for just that type.

If the app isn't installed, tapping Start Live Stream opens a download screen. \nLive Stream - First-Time Use \nSet permissions to use your phone's camera and microphone for Vagaro Live Stream. \n  \n There are icons to toggle your camera and microphone on and off under the video preview. \nToggle Start Recording  On  to start the recording when you start the class.

Tap a storage plan to enable Vagaro Drive and save the session recording. \nIf you already have Vagaro Drive but are low on storage space, you'll be prompted to upgrade your plan before you can save the recording. \nYou can leave feedback on your session's video and audio quality using a star-rating system. Tap Send Feedback to complete. \nAdditional Information \nThis feature works best with Vagaro Drive \n \n You must have Vagaro Drive activated to store live stream session recordings.

  "name": "iOS Appointment Widget",
  "body": " \n Add the Vagaro Pro widget for iOS 14 to your home screen to view your upcoming schedule at a glance and quickly access appointments. There are three widget sizes available to place anywhere on your home screen and reposition as you like. Tapping the widget or an appointment on it will take you to your Vagaro Pro calendar to manage appointments. The Vagaro Pro widget is available for all iPhones and iPads running iOS (and iPadOS) 14 and above. \n Here’s how to set up and use the Vagaro Pro widget. \nAdd iOS widget to your iPhone/iPad's Home Screen \nTouch and hold an empty space on the home screen until the app icons jiggle. \nTap the  +  button in the upper left corner of the screen. \nType “Vagaro” in the Search Widgets box to find the Vagaro Pro widget. \nScroll left and right to see the three sizes available. \nWith the widget size you want on the screen, tap Add Widget . \n  \n The widget is placed on your home screen. \nTap Done . \nNote \n The Vagaro widget updates appointments from your Vagaro Pro app every 15 minutes. Be aware that changes in the app (such as an appointment time change) may not be immediately reflected in the widget. \nEdit, Move and Delete the iOS Widget \n \n To change the Vagaro Pro widget's appearance or placement, or to delete it from your home screen, touch and hold the widget. A menu displays three options:  Edit Widget ,  Edit Home Screen , and  Remove Widget . \nEdit Widget \n \n Tap to edit the appearance of the widget. The choices are: \nSystem to match the system preferences \nLight to use a light scheme with a white background \nDark to use a dark scheme with a black background \nEdit Home Screen \n \n Move the widget around the screen to the place where you want it. This option works the same as rearranging all home screen icons – touch and hold until all begin to jiggle. \nRemove Widget \n \n Tap Remove on the confirmation screen to delete the widget. No data or apps are removed with this action, just the Vagaro Pro widget. (You can also remove a widget after selecting Edit Home Screen by tapping the minus icon on the widget.) \nUsing the iOS Widget \n \n Here are the actions you can take on each widget size. \n  Small Widget  \n Tap anywhere on the small widget to open Vagaro Pro to the calendar at the current date and time. From there, you can view appointments and act on them using the appointment menu. \n  Medium Widget  \n As with the small widget, tap anywhere in the widget to open Vagaro Pro to the calendar's current date and time. \n Tap an appointment shown on the widget to open the calendar to the appointment menu for that appointment. \n  \n  Large Widget  \n You can use both functions from the medium widget plus two additional icons in the large widget add: \nCustomers : Tap to open Vagaro Pro in your customer list. \nCheckout : Tap to open the checkout screen in Vagaro Pro. \nOnce you are in the Vagaro Pro app after tapping something on the widget, you can perform all the app's regular functions! \n",

  "body": " \n  \n The  Check-In App  allows customers to check in for a class or service by scanning a QR code onto a tablet. They can also book future appointments and purchase memberships from the app. \n \n Note \n Customers can check in even if they do not have an appointment or class scheduled for that day. \nPrerequisites \n \n The Check-In app is available to all Vagaro businesses for an extra charge. See pricing information . \nActivate the Check-In App Feature \nIf you haven't already, download the Check-In App from the  Apple App Store  or  Google Play . \nNavigate to Settings → Add-Ons → Check-In App . \n  Vagaro Pro : Start from More , then Settings → Add-Ons → Check-In App . \n \n Note \n You can also manage these settings from the  Check-In App  by tapping the   icon and signing in. \nClick Get Started to activate the feature, then configure the app settings. \nSelect a  color theme  for buttons shown in the app. \nClick the image next to the  Logo  to add a logo to the app. \n If you have a logo already set in your Venue Gallery, the app will use it. You can change the logo image for just the Check-In App. \nSet  Automatically Return to Home  set the inactivity period (how long before the app returns to the home screen.) \n Choices are 15, 30, 60, and 90 seconds. \nToggle Allow Customers to Check-In After Class . \n This sets a limit for how long after a class ends a customer can still check in, between 1 and 5 hours. \nSet  Play Sound  to Success, Failure, or None to play a sound for check-in actions. \nSet  Membership Purchase  to None, Required, or Optional. \nNone : no membership requirement. (Use none to remove any previously set requirement.) \nRequired : require a user to sign up for or purchase a membership during registration. \nOptional : give customers the option to purchase a membership during the registration process. \nToggle Prompt to scan membership card after purchase on to prompt the app to scan the customer's membership card. \nToggle  Membership Required to Check-In  on to require customers to have an active membership when checking in and prompt them to purchase one if they do not. \nUnder  Message to Customers with Inactive Memberships , enter a message you want to show to customers with deactivated memberships. \nToggle  Allow Customers to Purchase or Renew Memberships . \n This lets customers buy a new membership or renew an expired one using the app. \nToggle  Display a Custom Message After Customer Check-In  on and enter a message to show customers on the app. \n This custom message is shown with the request to confirm the customer's mobile number (next setting.) \nToggle  Confirm Customer Mobile Number During Check-In  on to ask for confirmation. \n When the customer checks in for an appointment, they see this screen: \nToggle  Hide Customer List Upon Check-In  to your preference. \n You can show a list of names for the customer to select from (or search) or ask them for their email to check in. \n If  On , customers are prompted to enter their email address and password. \n  \n If  Off , customers can search the list for their name. They must still enter the account password. \nKiosk Management : see Check-In App: Kiosks for details on kiosks. \nClick Save to finish. \nOnce you've activated the app and installed it on a tablet, you can manage all these configuration settings from within the app. Click the gear icon and then click Settings to access the options. \nDeactivate the Check-In App \n \n You can deactivate the Check-In App from the web and Vagaro Pro versions or from the Check-In App settings on your tablet. \n  On the Web or Vagaro Pro app : \nGo to Settings → Add Ons → Check-In App . \n  Vagaro Pro: Start from More , then Settings → Add-Ons → Check-In App . \nClick/tap the  Deactivate  button and then click/tap Deactivate on the warning screen. \nFrom a tablet running the Check-In app : \nTap the   icon, and sign in. \nTap Settings . \nTap the  Deactivate  button and then tap Deactivate on the warning screen. \nThe app is deactivated, and you will no longer be charged. \n You can reactivate the Check-In app at any time. \nAdditional Information \nGuided Access on iPhones and iPads \nUse  Guided Access  to restrict the iPhone or iPad you use for the  Check-In App  to show ONLY that app. Check Apple's help for more, or follow these steps. \nGo to your  Settings app . \nTap Accessibility . \nFind and open Guided Access and toggle it on. \n Set a passcode and time limits and toggle the  Accessibility Shortcut  on or off. \nTo start  Guided Access  for the Vagaro Check-In App, open the app and then start Guided Access, usually by triple-clicking the Home button or top button (depending on the iPad model.) \n To end  Guided Access , triple-click the Home or top button. Enter a passcode if you set one up. \nScreen Pinning on Android Devices \nScreen or window pinning on Android devices also lets you restrict the use of the device to only the  Check-In App . Because there are so many makes and models of devices running the Android OS, please search the web or your device maker's support pages for specific instructions. A good general search would be for \"screen pinning on [phone make and model].\" \nCustomer QR Code \nScanning the QR code on a customer's device is the fastest way to check in. Each customer of a Vagaro business has a unique QR code. \n Show your customer how to access their unique QR code for checking in on the app: \nLog in to the Vagaro customer app and tap  Profile  at the bottom of the screen. \nThe QR code is partially displayed. Swipe down on the screen to see the complete code. \nScan this code on the  Check-In App . \nRelated Articles \nCheck-In App: Kiosks \nCheck-In App: Memberships \nCheck-In App: Working with Customers \n",

  "body": " \n Follow the steps below to pair your new credit card reader with your device. \n  What's in this article?  \nPrerequisites (next) \nHow Do I Know Which Reader I Have? \nThe Pairing Process \nAdditional Information \nNote \n Vagaro's EMV reader is available for customers in the United States. For international customers, please see Using the WisePad3 Mobile with Vagaro Pro or Using the WisePOS E with Vagaro . \nPrerequisites \n \n Before pairing, please take note of the following information: \nEven if you have an EMV reader, you cannot process credit cards without Vagaro's Credit Card Processing . \nVagaro does not integrate with other payment processors. Non-Vagaro EMV readers will not pair with the mobile or web versions of Vagaro. \nHow Do I Know Which Reader I Have? \nThe Vagaro EMV Reader+ : \nAs of 3/13/2023, Vagaro has been shipping out the Vagaro EMV Reader+ to customers who purchase an EMV Reader or redeem the Free Credit Card Reader promotion. \nAll Vagaro EMV Readers+ have a USB-C charging port and a QR code used to pair with the device. \nCheck the back of the device for a serial number. EMV Reader+ has CHB3 for the first four digits of the serial number. \n  The Vagaro EMV Reader : \nEMV Readers received before 3/13/2023 are older models; however, we still provide free troubleshooting for these devices. \nThe Vagaro EMV Reader has a MicroUSB charging port and does not have a QR code on the back of the device. \nCheck the back of the device for a serial number. All Original EMV Readers (not EMV Reader+) have CHB2 for the first four digits. \nThe Pairing Process \n \n There are two types of EMV hardware used for processing customer payments securely: the EMV Reader+ and the EMV Reader. If you ordered your EMV reader after  3/13/2023 , you have the EMV Reader+. For more information on identifying which EMV Reader you have, see How Do I Know Which Reader I Have? \n  Do not pair your EMV reader through your Bluetooth settings . \nTurn on the reader by quickly pressing the power button. \nEMV Reader+ : When powered on, the reader will flash blue and beep three times. \nEMV Reader : When powered on, the reader will flash  Blue ,  Green , and  Red . \nNavigate to the  Checkout  screen, then tap Connect . \nThe option to select a Vagaro reader will display.

  "body": " \n   \n Vagaro offers competitive credit card processing rates and a wide range of other benefits, including the ability to sell services, products, memberships, products, and gift certificates online. You can also store credit cards, create cancellation and no-show policies, and require credit card payments online. \nAdditionally, you can receive a free credit card reader once the application is approved. This includes the  Vagaro Credit Card Reader . \nClick this link to learn about Signing up for Credit Card Processing \nTo get started, go to the Credit Card Processing page on Vagaro.com \nVagaro offers merchant services to businesses in the United States and \nAustralia ( Australia - Sign up for Credit Card Processing ) \nCanada ( Canada - Sign up for Credit Card Processing ) \nUnited Kingdom ( United Kingdom - Sign up for Credit Card Processing ) \nLet's take a closer look at the fees, rates, and benefits of signing up for Credit Card Processing! \nBase Rates and Fees \nImportant \n Transactions paid for with a  Card on File  are classified as  Keyed-In Transactions  even if the appointment was checked out in-house. \n Also, FANF and MasterCard Location fees for  Small Merchants  are absorbed by Vagaro. \n For reporting on all your business's credit card transactions and deposits, please see the Credit Card Deposits Report help article for more information. \nSmall Merchants \n \n For businesses with a processing volume of less than $4,000 per month. \nNo monthly fee \n2.75 per swipe \n3.5% +15¢ per keyed-in transaction \nLarge Merchants \n \n For businesses with a processing volume of more than $4,000 per month. \n$10 monthly fee \n2.2% + 19¢ per swipe \n3.0% + 19¢ per keyed-in transaction and association fees \nLarge merchants are required to pay a monthly association fee. These fees include Card-Present/Not-Present FANF rates based and a MasterCard Location Fee. Small merchants do not have to pay these fees; they are absorbed by Vagaro. Please see the FANF Monthly Costs section to learn more. \n The MasterCard Location Fee is a standard fee of $15 annually or $1.25 monthly. \nWhat is the Difference Between Swiped and Keyed-In Transactions? \n \n  Swiped Transactions  (In-House): \n  \n A transaction is classified as a \"swiped transaction\" when you slide the card's magnetic stripe through a reader. Also classified as \"swiped:\" transactions using cards with EMV chips and EMV card readers where the card is dipped (inserted into the reader) or tapped (the card touches the reader). Transactions using Apple Pay and Google Pay are considered \"swiped\" transactions. \n  Keyed-In Transactions  (Online or Card on File): \n  \n Payments made online or through a card on file are classified as  Keyed-In Transactions . Whenever the business or a customer has to manually enter credit/debit card information through the online marketplace or save a card on file, the transaction is considered \"keyed-in.\" Recurring payments for memberships and packages are considered keyed-in transactions. \nAdditional Fees \nACH Return ($20 ): Customers are required to keep banking information up to date. If the account information on file is wrong, through no fault of Vagaro Merchant Services (VMS), and we fail to verify your bank account information based on your provided information, a $20 fee will be charged for any deposit returned due to inaccurate bank account information. \nACH Reject ($20) : If your account is frozen, your financial institution may reject deposits. Each rejected deposit will automatically incur a $20 fee. \nChargeback ($20) : Upon a consumer initiating a chargeback, the consumer's financial institution immediately and without notice impounds the exact amount of funds at dispute from your account. We will provide details of the chargeback transaction, instructions/process on how to dispute and impose a $20 fee. \nRetrieval ($20) : If your customer requests their financial institution to investigate a transaction, VMS, per request, provides transaction information which automatically triggers a $20 retrieval fee. \nFANF Monthly Costs \n \n  For Large Merchants Only  \n FANF stands for Fixed Acquirer Network Fee. \n  Card-Present FANF Rates  \n If you take  card-present  (swiped) payments, your FANF cost will depend on the number of locations you have and whether you're considered a \"high volume\" industry. \nNumber of Locations  \nFANF per Location  \nHigh Volume FANF per Location  \n1-3 \n$2.00 \n$2.90 \n4-10 \n$2.90 \n$4.00 \n11-50 \n$4.00 \n$5.00 \n51-100 \n$6.00 \n$8.00 \n101-150 \n$8.00 \n$12.00 \n151-200 \n$10.00 \n$18.00 \n201-250 \n$14.00 \n$25.00 \n251-500 \n$24.00 \n$35.00 \n501-1,000 \n$32.00 \n$45.00 \nIf you have a monthly sales volume under $200, FANF will not apply. Businesses with a monthly volume of $200 – $1,250 will pay a FANF of 0.15% of the total volume instead of a fixed dollar amount from the table. \n  Card-Not-Present FANF Rates  \n If you accept \"card-not-present\" transactions (either online, where a customer enters their card details themselves, recurring payments, cards on file, or where you or your staff key in the card details instead of swiping); you'll pay  card-not-present  FANF rates.  Card-not-present  FANF is determined by your monthly volume at the rates listed in this table: \nMonthly Volume  \nMonthly Fee  \n$1,250 - $3,999 \n$7.00 \n$4,000 - $7,999 \n$9.00 \n$8,000 - $39,999 \n$15.00 \n$40,000 - $199,999 \n$45.00 \n$200,000 - $799,999 \n$160.00 \n$800,000 - $1,999,999 \n$450.00 \n$2,000,000 - $3,999,999 \n$1,000.00 \n$4,000,000 - $7,999,999 \n$2,000.00 \n$8,000,000 - $19,999,999 \n$4,000.00 \n$20,000,000 - $39,999,999 \n$8,000.00 \nAs with  card-present  rates, if you have a monthly sales volume under $200, the FANF will not apply. If your volume is $200 – $1,249, you'll pay 0.15% of the total volume instead of a set dollar amount. \n  What if my business has some card-present and some card-not-present?  \n If some of your transactions are  card-present  and some are  card-not-present  on the same merchant account, the  card-present  fees will still apply by location. The  card-not-present  fees will still apply by volume, but only the  card-not-present  transactions will be used to determine that volume. \n  Example : \n You have a single-location business with 90%  card-present  transactions and 10%  card-not-present  transactions. \n Your total sales volume is $100,000 in one month. You will be charged the  card-not-present  FANF rate for $10,000 of volume. (10% of $100,000.) You could expect to pay $15 in  card-not-present  FANF costs. \n",

  "name": "Yelp Integration",
  "body": " \n  Yelp Integration  is a great way to expand your online booking presence. You can promote your business and get customers to book your services directly from this page. \nPrerequisites \n \n  Available for all Vagaro businesses.  \nWhat's in this article? \nActivating the Yelp integration \nGeneral Rules about the Yelp integration \nWhat if I'm having issues with the integration? \nDeactivating the Yelp integration \nHow do I use this? \nActivating the Yelp integration \nNavigate to Settings → Add-Ons → Integrations . \nFind the  Yelp  integration. Then click  Learn More . \nClick the  Status  toggle switch to activate the integration. \nClick OK to enable the integration. \nYou will see a  Book Now  button on your Yelp page after the integration is successful. Clients will select this option to book appointments. \nAdditional Information \nGeneral Rules \nNote \n You can only activate the  Book Now  button on Yelp through Vagaro if your business is in the Beauty, Health, or Fitness general categories. \nYelp booking currently only works in the United States. \nYou must be out of your 30-day trial to enable this feature. \nBooking - Only one service can be booked at a time through Yelp. Packages and multiple appointments can't be booked at this time. \nPricing - Only services with a price of $1 or great will appear on Yelp. \nAppointment Approval - All appointments on Yelp are accepted immediately. Thus, the Yelp platform does not adhere to the approval process you have set in Vagaro. \nCancellation - The Cancellation Policy will be based on your Cancellation Policy at the time of booking. If you change it at a later time, Yelp remembers the old setting for the one appointment and honors that Cancellation Policy. \nCredit Card Capture - Yelp does not allow credit card capture at the time of booking but is looking to add this feature in the future. \nHouse Calls - Any appointments that are set as \"Mandatory\" House Call, will not appear on Yelp. Yelp requires the customer to go to your business location for the service. Services that have House Call as \"Optional\" will only show the business location. \nReminders / Confirmations - Your customers will receive confirmation, reminder, detail, and cancellation notifications from Vagaro when booking through Yelp. Yelp also sends customers the appointment detail information when the appointment is placed. The site, in addition, will send a notification when an appointment is canceled. The customer is added to the  Customer List  for future email marketing, promotions, and future bookings. \nWhat If I have issues integrating Yelp? \nPlease keep the following in mind: \nYour business must have at least one service provider who can accept booking online. \nA service provider must have at least one service with a set duration and a price greater than zero. \nThe name and address of the business on Yelp and Vagaro must match. Please be cautious about using special characters such as  '  or  - . These characters have a lot of variations that almost look the same. It is always safe to use characters found on your keyboard. \nDeactivating the Yelp integration \nTo deactivate the integration, follow these steps. \nGo back to Settings → Integrations . \nSelect  Learn More  under the  Yelp  option. \nToggle the  Status  option off to deactivate the integration. \nRelated Articles \n \n How to Track Yelp Bookings \n",

  "body": " \n  Generally, you'll have two types of Check-Outs: pre-set appointments made by the customers online or in-house using your calendar and walk-in customers. With walk-ins, you'll book and perform the service at once, perhaps adding products and future appointments to the check-out. \n  For booked services, you can check out appointments from the calendar or checkout screen. When checking out, you can add products, etc., to the check-out, apply fees, discounts, and points, and charge the customer using multiple payment methods, like credit and debit cards, cash, check, and Vagaro Pay Later. \n  Continue reading for details on checking out both booked appointments and walk-ins. \nPrerequisites \n \n  Available for all Vagaro businesses.  \nWhat's in this Article? \nStep One: Select a Customer or Appointment \nStep Two: Add to the Shopping Cart \nStep Three: Apply Discounts, Fees, and Points \nStep Four: Tipping and Receipt Settings \nStep Give: Charge the Customer \nStep Six: Rebook or Go to the Calendar \nStep One: Select a Customer or Appointment \n \n  For booked appointments, you'll start from either the Calendar to select the appointment, or the Checkout screen to choose an \"In Today\" customer for an appointment.

Extra $10 a month for each additional location (within Vagaro's Multi-Location Feature ). \n  Work or School Power BI Account : If you would like to use Vagaro's Power BI app, you will need a Power BI license. \n Please see here for Power BI's pricing. \n  Additional Requirements : \nIf you want to access your data with software other than Power BI, your business will need its own storage solution or third-party connector. \nA license may be required for any third-party business intelligence tools, connectors, or storage solutions. \nHow Can I Use My Data from Vagaro? \n \n Vagaro stores your business's data. With this data, you can generate reports within Vagaro. However, if you want to sync with third-party software, like HubSpot and Tableau, you will need to store that data first. You can pay a company to that store your data for you or store it yourself in-house. Vagaro provides you with the location of your data and a key to access it. This allows you to connect using a third-party software or our prebuilt Power BI app . \n Currently, Vagaro has a Power BI app that you can download from the Power BI App Marketplace. With this app, you can easily visualize your data in minutes. See here to learn more . \n  Vagaro does not currently integrate with other business intelligence software . \n For all other business intelligence software, you will need to pull the data first into a data storage solution or use a third-party connector. Once this is done, you can visualize your data in the software of your choice. The management, creation, and import of your data to your own data storage solution is up to your discretion. We cannot provide advice or support on how to set one up. Please refer to the documentation of your storage solution provider for more information. \n Any data you retrieve yourself or with Power BI will sync with Vagaro's Data Lake every 24 hours. \nEnable This Feature \nNavigate to Settings → Integrations under  Add-Ons . \nScroll down to the  Data Lake  integration, then click Learn More . \nClick Activate Integration . \nWait a few moments for your Data Location URL and Access Token to generate. \nOnce generated, you can use the Data Location URL and Access Token to gain access to your data. You can input these codes directly into Power BI \nMulti-Location Businesses \n \n With the Data Lake feature, you can access your data from multiple locations in one data lake. \n When you activate the integration, a pop-up will display where you can select the locations you want to include in the data lake. Please note that you can select just one or all of your locations; there is no limit. Click Activate when you are ready to activate. \n Click  Manage Locations  from the Data Lake integration page to add more locations. \n",

  "body": " \n  Vagaro Markup editor  allows you to draw on photos and SOAP Notes templates (face and whole-body). You can upload a picture of a client's face, for example. Using that image: draw circles and arrows, write text, add highlights and comments, etc. You can add notations to an uploaded photo, the SOAP Notes Face, and SOAP Notes Advanced templates.  Vagaro Markup editor  is available on both the web application and the Vagaro Pro mobile app. \n \n Important \n You must have  Vagaro Drive  to use the Vagaro Markup editor. See this article: Activate Vagaro Drive . \n \n  Related articles : \nAdd Soap Notes - Vagaro Pro app / Web Version \nUpload Files to SOAP Notes \nAccessing the Vagaro Markup Editor \n \n You can access the Vagaro Markup Editor when creating SOAP Notes and on image files that have been saved (using Vagaro Drive) to a customer's profile (appointment, customer, and forms.) Editable file formats are  .jpg ,  .png , and  .gif . \n When you upload an image file using a form or SOAP Notes, only the markup editor is invoked. When you use the  Open  option on the customer's Files page (go to  Customers , select a customer and then click or tap the Files tab), you'll have a choice of markup or image editor to use. (See [link to image editor article] for more.) \n You can also invoke the markup editor for image files on Vagaro Drive, in the Customers area for appointment, customer, and form files, and in the Business area. \n To open a file in the Markup editor: \nLocate the image file and click or tap the  Action  (3 horizontal dots) menu. \nVagaro Pro  \nWeb  \nOpen the file: \nVagaro Pro  \nWeb  \nNote \n Vagaro Pro opens the image in the markup editor. \n The Web version opens a detail screen for the file: \nWeb Version : Click the  Edit  icon and then select Markup editor. \nThe image in the Markup editor looks like this: \nVagaro Pro  \nWeb  \nUsing Markup Editor Tools \nOn the  Vagaro Pro app , the center grouping of tools is compressed for space with a  More  (3 vertical dots) menu to reveal the last three options: \n  \n Here are all the notation types you can add to images using the  Vagaro Markup editor : \n  Rectangle  \nDraw a rectangle on templates or uploaded images \nApply color, line width, and line style to the rectangle \nResize, move, and rotate \nFreehand draw/line  \nDraw a line on templates or uploaded images \nApply color and line width to the freehand line \nResize, move, and rotate \nArrow  \nDraw an arrow or straight line on templates or uploaded images \nApply color, line width, and line style to the arrow/line \nApply arrowhead styles (both ends, left or right, none) \nResize, move, and rotate \nText tool  \nAdd text anywhere on templates or uploaded images \nApply color and select font \nResize, move, and rotate \nCircle tool  \nAdd a circle to templates or uploaded images \nApply color to the outline \nApply color fill (or no fill) \nApply line width and line style \nApply opacity level to circle (affects both line and fill) \nResize, move, and rotate \nHighlighter tool  \nAdd a highlight rectangle to templates or uploaded images \nApply color and opacity level \nResize, move, and rotate \nComment tool  \nAdd a comment box with a pointer to templates or uploaded images \nApply color to text and comment box \nSelect font for text \nReposition the pointer \nResize, move, and rotate the comment box \nOther actions  \nThe selection arrow lets you click to select a previously added notation \nClick or tap the trash icon to delete the selected notation \nThe undo arrow steps backward, removing the last change you made \nClick or tap the checkmark to close the image or template and save your changes \n Returns you to the SOAP note screen \nClick or tap the  X  to close the image or template and discard your changes \n Returns you to the SOAP note screen \nTool selections  \nColor selector (all except the circle tool) \nLine width selector \nLine style selector \nArrow type selector \nFont selector \nCircle tool color selector \nOpacity level selector \nTo move, resize or rotate a notation, click the notation and use the handles to resize, or click in the middle of the notation and drag to reposition.

  "body": " \n Creating more broad services with specific add-ons can diversify your offerings for your customers. For example, creating a service for a Men’s Haircut and adding add-ons for a beard trim, full shave, or hot towel can reduce your menu by three different services. Using this method, customers will spend less time scouring your menu for the specific service they want and can design their appointment based on their needs. \n This article will cover the following: \nCreating an Add-On Category (next) \nCreating Add-Ons \nManually Apply Add-Ons to Services/Classes \nManaging Your Add-Ons \nRelated Articles: \nAdd a Service - Vagaro Pro app \nAdd a Class - Vagaro Pro app \nManaging and Creating Add-Ons for Services/Classes - Web Version \nImportant \n Following the steps below, you can create add-ons for both classes and services; however, keep in mind that some screens may look different. \nCreating an Add-On Category \nNote \n Add-On Categories are used to organize and manage your add-ons. When booking online, customers can select different add-ons nested in the category applied to the service or class. When creating add-on categories, you can set booking requirements, like requiring an add-on selection. \nNavigate to More → Settings → Things We Sell → Service / Class Menu . \nTap Services or Classes . \nTap Add , then tap Add-On Category \nEnter a category name. \n This name will be visible to customers/employees. A standard naming convention for add-on categories could be the add-on type. For example, if you provide an add-on like fragrances burned during a massage, your add-on category could be named \"Aromatherapy\" and contain add-ons for essential oils you provide. \nSelect One Add-On or Multiple Add-Ons . \nOne Add-On : When booking online or through in-house checkout, the customer can select one add-on from the add-on category. \nMultiple Add-Ons : When booking online or through in-house checkout, the customer can select multiple add-ons at a time. If you select this option, two fields will display:  Select at Least  and  Select at Most . Enter a value into  Select at Least  or  Select at Most  to set a minimum/maximum selection amount. This field can be set to zero. \n \n Note \n Toggling Require Add-On Selection on will automatically set Select at Least to one. \nToggle Require Add-On Selection on or off if you want to require an add-on selection from this category. \n  \n Required categories applied to a service will have a red  Required  icon when booking that service; the customer will not be able to finalize the appointment until a selection is made. \nTap Create . \n \n Note \n When an Add-On Category is created, it will populate the service/class menu. All add-on categories are labeled with a ( + ) icon and can be edited by tapping the category, then selecting edit. \nCreating Add-Ons \nNote \n You can convert existing services or classes to add-ons. See Convert Services or Classes to Add-Ons . \nTap an add-on category, then tap Add Add-On to directly apply an add-on to a category. \nCreate a name for your add-on. \n This is the name that employees and customers will see. Using the example in the previous section, an add-on name like \"Lavender Oil Treatment\" or \"Tea Tree Oil Treatment\" could be placed in an \"Aromatherapy\" category. \nAdd a description for your add-on, so customers can understand what they will receive. \nTap Category , then select an add-on category(if applicable). \nTap Used With , select one or more services or classes for which the add-on will apply, then tap Confirm . You can tap the ( - ) icon to apply the add-on to all services/classes in a category, or you can search with the  Search  function. \nIf you haven't created any services and classes yet, you can skip this step and apply Add-Ons to Services later.  \n Remember: When a customer goes to book an appointment online, they will have the option to select add-ons applied to that service or class. All add-ons will be grouped within their respective add-on category, even if you only applied one add-on from that category. If that category was set to  Required  or has a minimum/maximum selection amount, those options will carry over to the add-ons nested inside that category. \nEnter a  Business Cost  for the add-on (not for the service or class itself.) The business cost is what it costs your business to perform the add-on, not including employee wages. This may include costs to purchase consumable items, like tea tree oil, or a yoga studio rental booked for each class, but does not include the cost of an item that you reuse, like a comb or a towel. \nSelect one or more  Taxes  for the add-on. To create taxes, see Add a Sales Tax . \nToggle Show Add-On Online to display the add-on name and description when booking an appointment online. \nToggle Show Add-On Price Online to display the add-on name, description, and price when booking a service online. \nSet the base  Price, Duration, Points Given, and Points to Redeem  for the add-on. \nPrice : The price the business or service providers sell the add-on for \nDuration (Services Only) : Time it takes to perform the add-on. This can be set to zero. \nPoints Given : Points given to the customer for purchasing this add-on. \nPoints Redeem : Points needed to redeem this add-on for free \nTap Add Photo to set the add-on photo for online purchases, select Photo Library or Camera , then select/capture a photo. \nNote \n The maximum image size is 4 MB. Picture dimensions should be approximately 798px (width) x 894px (height). \nTap Save to create a new add-on. \nManually Apply Add-Ons to Services/Classes \n \n You can also manually apply add-ons to individual services/classes. \nTap the  Service  or  Class  you want to edit, then select Edit . \nTap Add-Ons Suggested . \n  \n From this screen, you can view add-ons already applied to the service/class. \n \n Note \n Required add-on categories will have a red  Required  icon. Below the add-on category name, follow  Choose # up to #  for how many add-on selections are required. Add-On categories with the grey  Optional  icon are not required. \nTap Modify to add recommended add-ons. \nSelect add-ons. Remember: Customers will have to make an add-on selection for required categories. \nTap Save , then tap Save again on the  Edit Service  page. \nManaging Your Add-Ons \n \n  Delete Add-Ons and Add-On Categories : \nTap the add-on or add-on category you want to delete. \nTap Delete . \nConfirm Deletion. \nTap Delete Add-On to confirm add-on deletion. \nIf you selected an add-on category to delete, an option to delete just the category or all add-ons nested inside the category will display. \n  \n Select Delete with all sub level , then tap Delete Add-Ons Category to delete both the category and add-ons nested inside. \n  \n Select Delete Add-On Category , then tap Delete Add-Ons Category to delete just the category. \nNote \n If the add-on or add-on category is tied to a package, membership, or discount/promo, you cannot delete it from the Vagaro Pro app. Use the web version for this action. \nRearrange Add-Ons : \nTap the add-on you want to move, then select Move to Category . \nSelect a category. \nThe add-on will be moved to the add-on category you selected. \n With the new add-ons feature, you can design your service/class menu to be more efficient than ever before. Creating intuitive add-ons in conjunction with services and classes will help keep your service/class menu more organized for a better customer experience.

Mention that there is no guarantee for approval. \nCharge a customer before performing a service for large VPL transactions. \n A VPL denial after a pricey service can be a difficult scenario to deal with. \nDON'Ts  \nHave multiple transactions with VPL for the same customer in a short period, including deposits. \n When a customer is approved for VPL with an initial deposit, the payment may fail when the remaining balance of the service is paid for. To prevent this from happening, you can set the deposit amount to 100% of the service price when paying with VPL. \n By setting the deposit for the full amount of the service, you ensure that the VPL payment is successfully processed and the service is fully paid for. This can avoid confusion or complications if the payment is denied when the balance is due. \nWe are here to help. Please contact Vagaro Support for any questions/concerns.  \n",

  "body": " \nCreate new revenue opportunities online by adding Vagaro Live Stream! Live streaming enables you to create online services in addition to your existing face-to-face services. Clients can book these remote services from the Vagaro App, Vagaro.com, or social media. Choose between live-streaming one-on-one sessions and live-streaming classes for multiple attendees. \n Vagaro Live Stream is fully automated and allows you to work from anywhere easily. Once clients have booked a live stream session, they will receive an automated confirmation containing a link to join the live stream. Vagaro automatically synchronizes with the scheduled class or service on the corresponding Vagaro calendar. If you change the date and time or cancel the live stream, Vagaro will automatically update the meeting and notify all the participants. \nWhat's in this article? \n \n Follow the steps below to set up Vagaro Live Stream and learn how to use it with Services and Classes. \nActivating or Deactivating Vagaro Live Stream \nHow Many Licenses Do I Need? \nSetting up a Service with Live Streaming \nSetting up a Class or Workshop with Live Streaming \nStart Live Stream for a Service, Class, or Workshop \nLive Stream - First-Time Use \nHow do I use this? \nActivating or Deactivating Vagaro Live Stream \nNavigate to Settings → Add-Ons → Live Stream . \nClick Activate . \n  \n Once Vagaro Live Stream is activated, you can deactivate it from the same screen by clicking the white Deactivate button. (See this article for information on switching from Zoom integration to Vagaro Live Stream.) \n \n Note \n If you have a merchant account, prepayment is required for all live stream classes and services to protect your business and ensure you get paid. Remember that you can have clients book Live Stream classes and appointments directly using the Online Shopping Cart (activate for $10/mo.) \nSelect the number of concurrent streams you want to offer. \nImportant \n When you activate Vagaro Live Stream, you have one license for $10/month. Any of your employees can use a license to live stream a class or service, and any number of customers (designated by you) can view the live stream. You must buy additional licenses to allow multiple concurrent live stream sessions. Each license gives you the ability to stream an additional simultaneous session. Again, each license can be used by any of your employees with any number of viewing participants (as limited when you set up the live stream option for a class or service.) \nIf you don't have Vagaro Drive, you can add it here by clicking a storage plan. \nImportant \n Without Vagaro Drive activated, you cannot save live-streamed events for later playback to customers. \nHow Many Licenses Do I Need? \nAll your employees can use your Vagaro Live Stream licenses. You do not need to have a license for each employee. You DO, however, need a license for each live stream session that will run concurrently. You can plan for the number of streaming sessions you want to run at once, but you can also add licenses when you add a new streaming service or class. Each additional streaming license is $10/month. \n When you are adding a new streaming class or service, the system checks for any other streaming sessions scheduled for the same time. If it finds that you do not have enough licenses for the additional session, you'll see this pop-up to add licenses: \n  \n Use the +/- buttons to adjust the number and click Save to finish. \nSetting up a Service with Live Streaming \nNavigate to Settings → Service/Class Menu . \nYou can edit an existing service or click Add to create a new service and then edit it. \n \n Note \n See Add a Service - Web Version to learn more about adding services. \nTo enable the streaming capability, turn on the  Live Stream  toggle setting. \nWhen done editing the service, click Save , and the service will now be offered as a live stream. \n \n Note \n Editing a service to add live streaming will only apply to future bookings. \nSetting up a Class or Workshop with Live Streaming \nClick Calendar, select an empty time slot, click, and select New Class . \n To edit a scheduled class, click the class and select Edit . \nTo add Live Streaming, enter the number of people who can participate in the  Live Stream Capacity  field, which activates the live stream option for this class. \nNote \n To make a class  In-House  or  Live Stream  ONLY, set a capacity for just that type. The \"0\" capacity type will be unavailable for booking. \nTo add attendees to a live-streamed class, click the class from the Calendar, hover over Add Attendees , select Live Stream , and add customer names from the list. \nNote \n When you look at a class on your calendar, you can see the number of attendees; hover over the circles to see the number of in-house or live-stream attendees. \nStart Live Stream for a Service, Class, or Workshop \nClick Calendar and then click the appointment you're going to begin live streaming. \n The video camera icon indicates classes and services are live-streamed. \nGo to  Change Status  and select Start Service (Live Stream Video) or Start Class (Live Stream Video) . \nVagaro Live Stream opens in a new tab. \n You can live stream from a computer or a mobile device. \nLive Stream – First-Time Use \nThe first time you start a Vagaro Live Stream session, you'll have to grant permissions and make selections for audio and video devices to use. Subsequent sessions will use these choices as defaults, though you can temporarily change any choices for a session when starting that session. \nA pop-up (look and feel are browser-dependent) dialog asks permission to use a webcam and microphone for Vagaro Live Stream. Select a webcam and microphone, set it to remember your choices, and click Allow . If you have more than one device, a drop-down list will show the devices for you to select. \nOn the session start-up screen, select devices to use and general settings for this and future sessions. \n  \n You will select speakers, set the speaker volume, select a microphone (the bars under the mic selection show that it is working), and the camera to use. There's an icon to toggle your camera and microphone on or off under the video preview. \nToggle Start Recording  On  to start the recording when you start the class. There will be an option to start and stop recording after the class starts. If you set this On the first time you use Vagaro Live Stream, it will be the default for all future sessions. \nToggle the Allow … for All switches to set up whether participants can turn their cameras and microphones on and off and whether you'll allow participants to use the Chat feature. \nWhen you're ready, click Start Appointment (or Class.) \nDuring the session, you can view your attendees' video streams, manage your view of all participants, view individual participants' customer profiles, and enable or disable the microphone, video, and chat for all or individual participants. \nWhen the class is over, click End Appointment (or Class). Click End Appointment (or Class) again on the confirmation dialog. \nThe recorded video plays for you to watch. \n You can edit the video name and description. \nYou can choose to save the recording to Vagaro Drive. \nIf you haven't already activated Vagaro Drive for your business, you'll see the  Vagaro Drive  info screen. Click a storage plan to enable Vagaro Drive and save the session recording. \nIf you already have Vagaro Drive but are low on storage space, you'll be prompted to upgrade your plan before you can save the recording. \nYou can leave feedback on your session's video and audio quality using a star-rating system. Click Send Feedback to complete. \nAdditional Information \nThis feature works best with Vagaro Drive \n \n You must have Vagaro Drive activated to store live stream session recordings.

With  Modify  set to on (green), the  Modify Price and Discount  settings are displayed for you to set. \n  \n You have several checkout areas to select from: \nServices \nClasses \nProducts \nGift Certificates \nMemberships \nPackages \nAnd can control what employees can do for  Price Reductions  and  Discounts  for each area. Choices for each are: \nCannot Modify \nCan Modify \nCan Modify With Limit \nSet these individually as needed. Note that  Can Modify With Limit  is set only by percentage, though the system will calculate the effect of a change in a dollar amount based on the percentage entered here. \n When an employee with this access level set to either  Cannot Modify  or  Can Modify With Limit  tries to change the sales price or discount during checkout, they will be required to get the approval of an employee who can modify the price or discount. Here's how that works: \n We'll use an employee with the following settings on this access level: \nGo to  Checkout  and select a customer. \nSelect a service, service provider, and start time to add to the cart. \nChange the service price to $60.00, or add a discount of 20% (remember they can only apply a 5% discount from the access settings), and the cart now reflects the change: \nFor this example, we'll use a cash payment, so enter $60.00 in  Cash  and click Checkout . \nThe  Approval Required  screen pops up. \nClick Next . \nAn employee with  Can Modify  access can scan their employee QR code or click their icon and sign in. \nOnce they enter their password and click Approve , the checkout is completed. \nThis workflow is the same whether the employee has a limit set (percentage) or has the  Cannot Modify  option set. The approving employee must have either  Can Modify  or  Can Modify With Limit  (set for a higher limit than the employee doing the checkout) to approve the transaction. \n \n Note \n Preset and Daily Deal discounts are not subject to these limitations. No approval is needed if an employee limited to offering a 5% discount uses a 15% Preset or Daily Deal discount. \n However, a Preset discount that employees can only offer with selected Access Levels will kick off the approval process. \nApproval for Price Changes from the Calendar \n \n Employees whose  Access Levels  have the  Cannot Modify  or  Can Modify with Limits  set under  Checkout  cannot change the price of a service from the  Calendar  without approval. Here's the process for changing the price from the Calendar: \nClick an upcoming appointment on the Calendar, and then click Edit . \nLower the price (or lower it more than the allowed percentage from the  Can Modify with Limits  setting). \nClick Save . \nClick Next on the  Approval Required  pop-up screen. \nSelect an employee who can approve the price change or have them scan their employee QR code and sign in. \nOnce they enter their password and click Approve , the price change will be saved. \nAccess Level Required to Offer Discounts \n \n When creating preset discounts, you can limit employees' ability to offer that discount at checkout by Access Level. Follow these steps. \nNavigate to Settings → Things We Sell → Discounts . \nSet your discount with a name, description, and start date/time. \nSet the next switches the way you want for this discount. \nSet  Access Level Required to Offer Discount (In-House Only)  to  On  (green). \nSelect which access levels will be allowed to offer the discount. \nFinish creating your discount and click Save . \nTo apply a limited discount at checkout for employees who do not have the access level needed: \nAfter adding an item to which the discount can apply, click the  Apply a Discount  drop-down list and select the discount. \n  \n You'll see the discount applied: \nSet up your payment method and click Checkout . The  Approval Required  screen displays. \nClick Next . \nSelect the approving manager or employee or have them scan their employee QR code. \nThe approving manager enters their password and clicks Approve to complete the checkout. \nTransaction List – Price and Discount Changes \n \n The transaction list report highlights changes made from checkout to prices and discounts. Discounts and price changes show in the report as hyperlinks that you can either click or hover over to get details about the change. \nWeb Version \nNote that in the section of a transaction list report above, the  Disc  in the 1 st and 2 nd rows and the  Price  in the 3 rd row are blue (hyperlinks). \n In the first row, the discount results from a preset discount, so when you hover over the link, you see the discount's name (and promo code). \n The discount in the second row was a manual change by the employee during checkout. When you click the link, a pop-up shows what was changed and who approved the change: \n  \n In the third row, the price was manually changed at checkout, so the pop-up box shows the change and who approved it: \n  \n Lastly, notice in the fourth row that there  is  a discount applied for $1, and the price of the item was first reduced to $2.65… leaving a payment of $1.65. However, because these changes were within the limits of the employee who sold the product, there is no link to highlight the change. \nVagaro Pro app \n \n The  Transaction List  report looks different on the Vagaro Pro app. Here's what the various discounts and price change entries look like. \n Individual entries in the Transaction List report: \n  \n Tap the arrow to see the transaction detail. When a preset discount is applied, it will appear as link text. Tap the link to see which discount and promo code was used. \n  \n An arrow indicates a discount or price change that requires approval. Tap the arrow for details. \nRemember that if changes to a discount or price were within the limits of the employee who sold the product, there is no arrow to highlight the change. \n",

If you set the day of the week to Monday ON a Monday, the next date will default to the following Monday. If you set it to Tuesday on a Monday, the collection will start the next day. \nToggle Require Rent Contract if you want them to sign a rental agreement as part of the process. \n  \n  Vagaro Forms  is required to use this feature and has a built-in Rental Contract form for you to use, or you can create your own rental form. \n \n Note \n You cannot edit the form on the Vagaro Pro app. \nSelect the  Payment Method : \nSelect Bank Account or Credit Card for the  Primary Payment Method . \nIf you want to require that renters provide a  Backup Payment Method , toggle the switch to  On . \nAdd  Renters . \n See the next section. \nTap Save . \nNote \n  You can disable recurring rent for all employees anytime by toggling the switch off.

Sep 1, and then the service provider does not fill out the information until Sep 10 and misses the weekly rent payment date of Sep 6. When the service provider fills out their information on Sept 10, they'll also be charged on that day for the missed rent of Sep 6. And after their payment will be taken on the regular rent cycle on Sep 13. \n  Note : If the business changes the rent charge frequency, unpaid rent from renters with \"Pending Request\" status will not be collected. \n \n The  Add Renter  screen will show the following: \nFor  Request Renter Completion , the request will include: \nPrimary payment method (bank account or credit card) \nBackup payment method (bank account or credit card) - if configured \nRent Contract - if required \nFor  Fill Payment Information : \nPrimary payment method to fill in (bank account or credit card) \nBackup payment method to fill in (bank account or credit card) - if configured \nIf you require a  Rent Contract , the  Fill Payment Information  screen will show that the contract will be available for the renter to sign in their profile under  Rent Collection  \nAdditional Information \nPause Rent Collection \nYou can suspend rent collection for employees from the Rent Collection page for renters who have provided their payment information. \nSelect a renter from the list, tap the renter's chip, and select Pause Rent . \nTap Pause on the confirmation box. \nThe chip for that renter will have a gray bar to indicate that rent collection is Paused. \n To resume collecting rent, tap Resume Rent on the same action menu. \nBack Rent \n When you pause and resume rent collection, the renter is charged for any rent that was due during the pause.

We will cover the Search Options options: \nName \nContact information: \nEmail \nAddress, city, state, zip code \nPhone (cell, day, and night numbers) \nReferred By \nGeneral Tag \nAnd each of the  Filter  options (click a link to jump to the detail for that filter): \nAge \nAmount Paid \nBirth Month \nBooking \nCustomer Note \nCustomer Since \nGender \nLast Visit \nMembership \nNo Show/Cancel \nPoints Earned \nServices/Classes \nService Provider \nSearch Options \n \n There are three text fields at the top of the  Customers List  report page. Use these to search for all or part of customer information. \n  \n  Name : Enter all or part of a customer's name (first, middle, and last) in the field and click Run Report . \n  Contact Information : \n Use the  Mail/Address/Ref.By/Gen.Tag  box to enter all or part of a customer's mailing address: Street number, Street name, City, State, and Zip Code, then click Run Report . \nFor example , you could run a report using just the number 3000 to find all customers with a house number of 3000. Be careful, though! Since the search uses all the fields listed, you could get customers with the number '3000' in their email address or as part of their zip code. \nYou can also use the same field to look for the customer's email address, referring customer name, or any general tags you have applied to customers. \n  Cell / Day / Night Phone : \n Use the Cell / Day / Night phone field to enter a customer's phone number and click Run Report . \n \n Important \n Search and Filter options combine to create \"and\" conditions. If you enter all or part of a customer's name and all or part of an address, the search looks for customers that meet BOTH conditions. So, if you have no customers with the first name of Sarah  and  a phone number that contains  4331 , you will get no results in the report. \nFilters \n \n   Customer Since  \nThis date field looks at the  Customer Since  field on the customer's profile (the date the account was created.) You can select preset date ranges using the buttons or set a date range by clicking dates on the calendars to create FROM and TO ranges. Click Submit when you've set the options. \nLast Visit  \nThis date field looks at the  Last Visit  field on the customer's profile (the date of the customer's last appointment or class.) You can select preset date ranges using the buttons or set a date range by clicking dates on the calendars to create FROM and TO ranges. Click Submit when you've set the options. \nCustomer Note  \nThis text field looks at customer notes. Enter all or part of a keyword from a note. Note that  Customer Notes  are not included in the generated lists or printed/exported reports. \n   Services / Classes  \nSelect one service or class from the list. The selection list includes service bundles, custom classes, and custom services. \n   Service Provider  \nA list of all service providers, with checkboxes for selections. Use Select All , Select None , or check individual service providers to include in the search. \n   Membership  \nA list of your memberships, with checkboxes for selections. Use Select All , Select None , or check individual memberships to include in the search. \n   Birth Month  \nUse this filter to determine which customers have a birthday in a given month. Select a month from the drop-down list. \n   Gender  \nChoices are  Male ,  Female , and  Non-Binary . \n   Email  \n  \n This filters for customers with or without an email address on file. Select from  All  (default),  With Email , and  Without Email . \n   Booking  \nBooking  is a From/To field. Enter numbers for a range of how many bookings have been made by customers. Enter the same number in both fields to find customers who have made just that number of bookings. \n   Points Earned  \nPoints Earned is a From/To field. Enter numbers for a range of points earned by customers or the same number in both fields to see those with a specific number of points. \n   Amount Paid  \nEnter a range in the From/To fields for  Amount Paid  to find customers' total spent with your business. You can enter the same number in both fields to find a specific amount. Combined with the  Last Visit  field, you could run a report to find which customers have spent the most (or least) with you during a specified date range. \n   No Show/Cancel  \nEnter a number range to see no-show or canceled appointments. \n   Age  \nFind all customers of a specific age (enter the same age in both From/To fields) or within an age range. \n",

  "body": " \n Memberships allow you to seamlessly add discounts to multiple services, classes, and products at once. You can offer discounts based on a set number of visits and set specific  auto-renew  options, which allow you to charge clients automatically based on the charge frequency you set (this is only applicable to businesses in the United States). \n If you choose to require auto-renewal, you can set the  Auto-Renew Limit  or the number of times you want to renew the membership. This gives you more flexibility and control and provides clients with more payment options. \n  In this article, we will go over:  \nPurchase Membership Cards \nAdd a New Membership \nAdd Services and Classes to Memberships \nAdd Discounts and Visits to Multiple Services and Classes \nGrouping Services and Classes \nAdd Products \nAdd Discounts and Set Product Quantities \nGrouping Products \nExport and Print a Membership List \nSet Access Levels for Memberships \nRemember, once memberships are created, they can be sold across multiple platforms, including the  Checkout  screen, the  Vagaro Check-in App ,  Online Booking Page , and  Custom Website . \n \n Important \n When a renewing membership payment fails, Vagaro will attempt to retry the customer's card two times after the initial failure. \n  Sunday : Renewal fails. Membership status changes to \"inactive,\" and the customer can't use their membership visits. \n  Tuesday : Vagaro attempts to charge their card again. If the payment goes through successfully, the membership status changes to \"active.\" If the transaction fails on Tuesday, the membership will remain \"inactive.\" \n  Friday : Vagaro attempts to charge the card again. If it fails, the membership will remain inactive until manually reactivated by the business. \nPurchase Membership Cards \nClick the Shopping Cart icon to open the Vagaro online store. \nNote \n You can also access the Vagaro online store from the membership page: Settings → Things We Sell → Memberships . Click Order Now to get to the Vagaro Online Store. \nScroll down until you come to the entries for  Custom Plastic Membership Cards . \nSelect a package size and then how many of that package size you want to order. \n Package options are for 100, 250, 500, 1,000, 1,500, and 10,000 cards, and the price per card is based on the quantity. \nSee Vagaro Online Store for details on ordering Vagaro products. \nAdd a New Membership \nNavigate to Settings → Things We Sell → Memberships and click New Membership . \n  \n The  New Membership  screen is broken into several sections. \nEnter a name for this membership and a description. Then enter the price, select a tax rate from the  Tax  drop-down menu, enter  Reward Points , and select a  Charge Frequency  from the drop-down menu. \n  \n  Charge Frequency : Choose how long the billing cycle will be. \nToggle Auto Renew off or on (default is on) and then enter the  Auto Renew Limit . \n This lets you set the number of times the membership can renew, or you can set it to  Unlimited . \n  \n Select Carry Balance Forward to let customers carry unused visits into the next billing cycle. \nIf you want to offer an initial discount, toggle Discount Initial Payments on (green). \nSet a discount either as a dollar amount or a percentage. \nEnter the number of  Billing Cycles  to apply the discount, or use  Unlimited  for a non-expiring discount. \nToggle Show Membership Online On (green) to display the membership on your Vagaro website and widget. \n  \n If you toggle Show Membership Online to  On  (green,) the  Suggest as Upsell When Booking a Participating Service or Class  option will display. When toggled  On , the  Upsell  feature will suggest  Memberships  to customers purchasing  Services ,  Classes ,  Products , and  Add-Ons  attached to that membership.  \nNote \n The image below displays what customers will see when they check out an item attached to a membership. \nToggle Allow Membership Discount on top of Daily Deals on to allow membership discounts in addition to discounts offered in your daily deals for services, classes, or products. \nToggle Allow Membership Discount on top of Other Discounts on to include the membership discount with any  Preset  or  Promo Code  discounts you're offering to your customers. \nToggle Allow Membership to be Shared with Family &amp; Friends on to let customers share their membership benefits with others. \n  \n You can select the types of relationships customers can share with and set a maximum number of Family &amp; Friends to share with. \nAdd Services and Classes to Memberships \nClick the  Services/Classes  tab and then click Add . \nSelect services or classes, and click Add . \n  \n We'll cover  Grouping  in a later section. \nAdd Discounts and Visits to Multiple Services and Classes \nClick Mass Edit in the  Service  tab to apply discounts to multiple services and classes at the same time. \nSelect All Categories and All Services/Classes to add discounts to all the items, then enter the discount. \n  \n You can use a percentage discount or make the selected services or classes free, and select how many visits you'll grant the discount or make it unlimited. \nClick Apply when done with these discounts. \nGrouping Services and Classes \n \n Use  Grouping  to combine multiple services and classes in a  Membership  to set a single discount and number of visits that applies to the entire group.

  "name": "Credit Card Batch Deposits - Schedule & FAQ",
  "body": " \n Here's all you need to know about credit card batch schedules and when credit card transactions deposit into your bank account. \n \n Note \n This article refers to the batch deposit schedule for customers in the  United States . For articles on credit card processing in other countries, go to the Vagaro International Support category. \n \n  Related Article : Vagaro Credit Card Processing Fees and Rates \nWhat Does Batch Mean? And What Is a Batch Schedule? \n \n In simplified terms, \"batch\" means a group of multiple processes, things, or items produced at the same time, like baking a batch of cookies. When your transactions are \"batched\" into one deposit, the total revenue generated during the previous business day is grouped together into one sum (minus credit card processing rates and fees) and deposited into your bank account. \n The batch schedule indicates the cutoff for what transactions will be included in the batch and what time it will be deposited into your account. \nBatch Time and Deposit Schedule \n \n Transactions processed before  3 PM Pacific Time / 6 PM Eastern Time  are included in a single batch. The funds will deposit into your bank account  one business day  (this varies by financial institution) after the 3 PM PST / 6 PM EST cut-off time.  If a transaction is processed after the 3 PM / 6 PM cut-off time, it will be batched with the next day's transactions . Because banks are usually closed on weekends, transactions that occur on a Friday, Saturday, or Sunday will be deposited into your bank account the following Tuesday. \n2023-2027 Holiday Schedule \n \n  Transactions that occur on a holiday are usually deposited into your bank account in two business days. \nHow Do I Change My Bank Account for Deposits \n \n You can change banking or routing information from the Merchant Account page. Follow the steps below. \nVagaro Pro app \nNavigate to More → Credit Card Processing . \nTap the  Merchant Info  tab. \nTap Edit . \nEnter your Social Security Number and Driver's License/Identification Number, then tap Verify . \nSave your changes. \nWeb Version \nClick your profile icon, then click Merchant Accounts . \nClick the  Merchant Info  tab. \nClick Edit . \nEnter your Social Security Number and Driver's License/Identification Number, then click Verify . \nSave your changes. \nAdditional Help / Questions \nMissing and Failed Deposits \nMissing Deposits \n \n If you are missing deposits, multiple reasons, like incorrect banking information or a federal holiday, could delay deposits. \n For more information on why you might be missing your deposits and the steps to receive those funds, please see I'm Missing Credit Card Deposits? \nFailed Deposits \n \n A failed deposit occurs when a deposit fails to transfer into your or an employee's bank account. \n This can happen for various reasons, including incorrect banking information, a mismatch between the legal business name and bank account name, or the bank account being closed or frozen. \n It can take up to two to three business days for a deposit to be returned to Vagaro, and another business day, depending on the day of the week or holiday schedule, to deposit those funds into your account. \n You will also be charged a  $20 return fee  for failed deposits. \nDeposit Smaller Than Expected \n \n Deposits may be smaller than expected because: \nProcessing and association fees with Credit Card Processing \nTransactions were processed after the cut-off time \nCustomer chargebacks \nCustomer refunds \nYou can review details about your deposits from the Deposit Report . \n Please contact support if none of the reasons above explain your smaller-than-expected deposit. \nCan I Change the Batch Cut-Off Time? \nYes. You can change the batch cut-off time to  12 AM PST  or  3 AM EST . All transactions processed that day will be batched into one deposit. Send a request to support@vagaro.com or call (925) 464-1932 ext. 2 to change your batch cut-off time. Please note that this delays the deposit date. \n From then on, future batched funds will take two business days to deposit into your bank. \nWhere Do I See My Deposits in Vagaro? \nDeposits can be found in the Deposits Report . With this report, you can review information on chargebacks, refunds, and association and processing fees. \n",

We cannot create a merchant account without this information. \n Even if you plan to use our merchant services as a business or organization, you must provide your individual name, mailing address, date of birth, and a valid SSN. If you are an LLC and a Private or Public Corporation, then you need the previously mentioned information as well as an EIN. \nWhat Information is Required to Complete the Application \n \n Federal law requires that all financial institutions verify and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. \n The following information is  required  to activate your Vagaro merchant account: \nDoing Business As : Name shown on the customer's credit card statement \nLegal Business Name - Registered with City or State  \nBusiness Address  \nMonths/Years in Business  \nType of Business  \nWhat industry do you serve?  \nFull Legal Name  \nUS Home Address  \nPhone Number : Shown on the customer's credit card statement \nEmail Address  \nSocial Security number  (SSN) and  Employer Identification Number  (EIN): EIN is not required if you are a sole proprietor \nDate of birth : Current credit card regulations require our customers to be 18 years of age or older to create a merchant account \nState-Issued ID : Driver's license or ID \nUS-Based Bank Account Information  \nAccount Type  \nNeed Help?/More Information \nChoosing an Industry Type \nPlease select the best industry type that fits your service/class offerings. \n  To take  FSA  and  HSA  payments, you must select one of the following  industries  (from the  What industry do you serve?  question) when signing up for credit card processing . \nChiropractors, Chiropractic Offices (FSA/HSA) \nMedical Services and Health Practitioners (FSA/HSA) \nYou can change your industry type after your merchant account has been created. \nRegister Your Legal Business Name \nLearn more from the Small Business Administration : \n Set your legal business name as your legal name if you are a sole proprietor. \n \"Your location and business structure determine how you’ll need to register your business. Determine those factors first, and registration becomes very straightforward. \n \"For most small businesses, registering your business is as simple as registering your business name with state and local governments. \n \"In some cases, you don’t need to register at all. If you conduct business as yourself using your legal name, you won’t need to register anywhere. But remember, if you don’t register your business, you could miss out on personal liability protection, legal benefits, and tax benefits.\" \n Merchants can change the  Doing Business As  (DBA) on their account, not the legal business name. If you want to change your legal business name on Vagaro, you will need to contact support ( support@vagaro.com ) with documentation supporting that change. \nWhat is an EIN? \nLearn more from the IRS : \n  The  Employer Identification Number  ( EIN ) is a unique nine-digit number assigned by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to businesses working in the U.S. It's used to identify taxpayers who are required to file various business tax returns. \n  For the credit card processing application, only Sole Proprietorship business types do not require an EIN . \n See How to Apply for an EIN from the IRS website to learn how to apply for an EIN. \nChoosing a Business Type \nWhen signing up, you must classify how you’ll use our merchant services by selecting your  Business Type .

Sole proprietors usually have their legal business name set to their legal name. \nLimited Liability Company (LLC) \n A business type that protects business owners from personal responsibility for their business's debts and liabilities while providing better tax advantages than a sole proprietor. \nPrivate Corporation (Privately Owned Business) \n Your business must file  Articles of Incorporation  to create a business entity. \nPublic Corporation (Publicly Traded on the Stock Market) \n Your business must file  Articles of Incorporation  to create a business entity. \nWhy Wasn't My Application Approved? \nIf your application is denied, do not be alarmed; we are here to help. Our Customer Support team will reach out to every customer whose application is denied. Please be on the lookout for any emails from our team. \n There are multiple reasons your application might have been denied.

  "name": "How to Auto-Assign Employees for Online Booking",
  "body": " \n If you want to make your customer's booking experience as simple as possible, we recommend that you turn on  Auto-Assign Employee When Booking . With Auto-Assign turned on, customers no longer need to select a service provider when booking online. A service provider will automatically be assigned to the service based on your settings. \n This is great for businesses that are commission based and want new appointments auto-assigned. \n \n Take Note Before Reading \nWhen a customer selects the time for their appointment, the available times will be a combination of all availability between all service providers that perform that service. \nWhen a customer selects an appointment timeslot, an employee is automatically assigned . \nAuto-Assign only affects customers booking online. You can still select an employee when booking in-house. \nAuto-Assign only applies when booking Services. Classes are not affected because the instructor is already assigned to a class. \nWhen a customer books a recurring appointment, the auto-assign setting still applies. A customer may not be assigned to the same employee for recurring appointments. \nAn employee is auto-assigned to a service when: \nThey offer the service. \nHave Online Booking active. \nThe employee is available. \nThe employee's name is removed entirely from the customer booking experience. This includes push notifications, emails, in-app notifications, text notifications, waitlists, and the customer's appointment page. \nWhat's in this Article? \nPrerequisites (next) \nConfigure Your Settings \nAuto-Assign and Online Booking Order \nPrerequisites \n \n  Available for all Vagaro businesses.  \nConfigure Your Settings \nVagaro Pro App \nNavigate to More → Settings → Online Appointment Rukes under  Booking . \nScroll down and toggle Auto-Assign Employee When Booking on. \nUnderneath this setting, select your  Service Provider Order . \nTap Save . \nWeb Version \nNavigate to Settings → Online Appointment Rules under  Booking . \nScroll down and toggle Auto-Assign Employee When Booking on. \nUnderneath this setting, select your  Online Employee Booking Order . \nClick Save in the bottom-right corner. \nAuto-Assign and Online Booking Order \n \n How an employee is automatically assigned to a service depends on your Online Booking Order. There are five options you can select from: First Available, Website Employee Lineup, Most Open Schedule, Best Reviewed, and Alphabetical Order. These options change how an employee is automatically assigned to a service booked by a customer. \n  First Available : \n Any available employees may be assigned. \n  Website Employee Lineup : \n Auto-Assign prioritizes the first employee in your Website Employee Lineup. If that employee is fully booked or unavailable, Auto-Assign will automatically move on to the next employee in the lineup and continue in that order. \n  Most Open Schedule : \n Auto-Assign prioritizes the employee with the most availability on that day. The employee is prioritized by the total hours available, not how many appointments they have. For example, an employee with six out of eight hours available will take priority over an employee with only four hours available. Once the most-available employee is fully-booked, Auto-Assign will prioritize the employee with the second-most availability. \n  Best Reviewed : \n Auto-Assign prioritizes the employee with the highest rating (out of five). A low-rated employee will only be booked when other employees aren't available. \n  Alphabetical Order : \n Auto-Assign prioritizes appointments alphabetically (from A to Z). \nAdditional Information \n \n If you want to hide your employee names from your business entirely, you can select to hide an employee from your  Staff  tab.

  "body": " \n Creating more broad services with specific add-ons can diversify your offerings for your customers. For example, creating a service for a Men’s Haircut and applying add-ons for a beard trim, full shave, or hot towel can reduce your menu by three different services. Using this method, customers will spend less time scouring your menu for the specific service they want and can design their appointment based on their needs. \n This article will cover the following: \nCreating an Add-On Category (next) \nCreating Add-Ons \nManually Apply Add-Ons to Services or Classes \nManaging Your Add-Ons \nRelated Articles: \nAdd a Service - Web Version \nAdd a Class - Web Version \nManaging and Creating Add-Ons for Services/Classes - Vagaro Pro app \nCreating an Add-On Category \nNote \n  What are Add-On Categories?  \n Add-On Categories are used to organize and manage your add-ons. When booking online, customers can select different add-ons nested in the category applied to the service or class. You can set booking requirements when creating add-on categories, like requiring an add-on selection. \nNavigate to Settings → Service/Class Menu , then click Services or Classes . \nClick the  Add  drop-down menu, then click Service Add-On Category or Class Add-On Category . \nEnter a category name. \n  \n This name will be visible to customers/employees. A standard naming convention for add-on categories could be the add-on type. For example, if you provide an add-on like fragrances burned during a massage, your add-on category could be named \"Aromatherapy\" and contain add-ons for essential oils you provide. \nSelect One Add-On or Multiple Add-Ons . \nOne Add-On : When booking online or through in-house checkout, the customer can select only one add-on from the add-on category. \nMultiple Add-Ons : When booking online or through in-house checkout, the customer can select multiple add-ons at a time. If you select this option, two fields will display:  Select at Least  and  Select at Most . Enter a value into  Select at Least  or  Select at Most  to set a minimum/maximum selection amount. This field can be set to  No Minimum  or  No Maximum  (or Zero). \nToggle Require Add-On Selection on or off if you want to require an add-on selection from this category. \n  \n Required categories applied to a service or class will have a red  Required  icon when booking the appointment; the customer will not be able to finalize the appointment until a selection is made. \nClick Create . \nNote \n When an Add-On Category is created, it will populate the service/class menu. All add-on categories are labeled with a ( + ) icon and can be edited by clicking the category or the  Action  menu (3 vertical dots), then selecting Edit . \nCreating Add-Ons \nNote \n You can convert existing services or classes to add-ons. See Convert Services or Classes to Add-Ons . \n \n Add-ons can be used to customize your service/class menu. Create and apply optional or required add-ons to services and classes to make them more customizable. \nTo create an add-on in an existing Add-On category, click the  Action  menu (3 vertical dots) next to an add-on category, then hover over Insert and click Add-On . \nDrag and drop an image for your add-on or click Choose File , then select a file. \nImportant \n Adding a file will open the Vagaro Image Editor. From this screen, you can crop, add effects, and resize your image. The maximum file size is 4 MB. Picture dimensions should be approximately 798px (width) x 894 (height). \nEnter an  Add-On  name. \n This is the name that employees and customers will see. Using the example in the previous section, an add-on name like \"Lavender Oil Treatment\" or \"Tea Tree Oil Treatment\" could be placed in an \"Aromatherapy\" category. \nEnter a description for your add-on, so customers can understand what services they will receive. \nOpen the  Assigned to  drop-down menu and select services or classes that will offer the add-on. You can use Select All if you want this add-on to apply to all services or classes you offer, or you can search with the  Search  function. \nIf you haven't created any services and classes yet, you can skip this step and apply Add-Ons to Services later.  \n Remember: When a customer goes to book an appointment online, they will have the option to select add-ons applied to that service or class. All add-ons will be grouped within their respective add-on category, even if you only applied one add-on from that category. If that category was set to  Required  or has a minimum/maximum selection amount, those options will carry over to the add-ons nested inside that category. \n \n Note \n Click the ( i ) icon to learn more. \nEnter a  Business Cost  for the add-on (not for the service or class itself.) The business cost is what it costs your business to perform the add-on, not including employee wages. This may include costs to purchase consumable items, like tea tree oil, or a yoga studio rental booked for each class, but does not include the cost of an item that you reuse, like a comb or a towel. \nSelect one or more  Taxes  for the add-on. To create taxes, see here . \nUse the  Performed By  toggle to select employees that provide this add-on, then set individual options per employee. Add-ons are only suggested if the employee performs both the service/class and the add-on. \n  \n Depending on service providers’ access levels , they can navigate to Settings → Employee Profiles → Services to edit their preferences, like duration and price, for the add-on. Admins and the account owner can manually set prices, durations, and points from this screen. \nPrice : The price the business or service providers sell the add-on for \nDuration (Not Applicable for Classes) : Time it takes to perform the add-on. This can be set to zero. \nPoints Given : Points given to the customer for purchasing this add-on \nPoints Redeem : Points needed to redeem this add-on for free \nIf you want to set a base price, duration, and points for all service providers, see Copy Prices to Another Employee . \nManually Apply Add-Ons to Services or Classes \n \n You can also manually apply add-ons to individual services or classes. \nFrom the  Service  or  Class  tab, click the  Service  or  Class  you want to edit. \nIn the  # Suggested Add-Ons  section, click View to see applied, optional, and required add-os. \n Required add-on categories will have a red  Required  icon. Below the add-on category name, follow  Choose # up to #  for how many add-on selections are required. Add-On categories with the grey  Optional  icon are not required. \nClick Modify to apply add-ons to a service or class. \nNote \n Suggested Add-Ons are displayed to customers and employees through in-house checkout and the online booking page. Creating too many add-on selections for a customer may be overwhelming. So, when designing your service/class menu, keep your Suggested Add-Ons organized and user-friendly for the best customer experience. \nSelect add-ons and add-on categories to apply to the service or class. \n  \n You can also click Select All or Deselect All to select or deselect all add-ons from the list. \nClick Assign , then click Save on the Edit Service screen to finalize changes. \nThe  # Suggested Add-Ons  value will change based on the add-ons selected. \nManaging Your Add-Ons \n \n  Deleting an Add-On or Add-On Category : \nSelect an add-on or add-on category you want to delete \nClick the  Action  menu (3 vertical dots), then select Delete . \nConfirm deletion. \nTo confirm deletion, click Delete . \nWhen deleting an add-on category with nested add-ons, the options below will display. \n  \n Select Delete Category and its Add-Ons , then click Delete Category to delete the entire add-on category and nested add-ons. \n Select Delete Category , then click Delete Category to delete just the add-on category. \nMoving Add-Ons to Add-On Categories : \nSelect the add-on you want to move. \nClick the  Action  menu (3 vertical dots), hover over Move To , then select an add-on category. \n",

  "body": " \n Vagaro is adding a plethora of reports imported from the Web version. You can now view reports on  Sales ,  Customer Retention , and more. \n  Reports added to the Vagaro Pro app and Dashboard : \nSales Summary \nPayment Distribution \nServices/Classes \nSales \nCustomer Retention \nRebooking \nRent &amp; Fees \nCancellation &amp; No-Shows \nIOUs \nImportant \n Please view the articles above to learn more about each new report. Keep in mind that some screens and steps may look different. \nHow to Run a Report \nNavigate to More → Reports . \nSelect a  Report . \n  For this example, the Sales Summary report is selected.  \n Mobile reports will display differently than their Web counterparts. When setting a date range, the data will automatically refresh, and you will not have to re-run a report. You can apply filters and print from the  Filter  and  Print  icons. \n The web version of this report shows the sales types on individual rows. The mobile version shows each type as a \"card.\" You'll see a  card  for each sale type, whether there's a value or not (like the web version.) \n You can drill down for more details in a report if a  card  has a right-arrow icon. Report drill-down allows you to see more data about a specific card on a report. For example, you can drill down  Service Sales  to see a report on all service transactions during a selected period. \nTap Date Range . \nSelect a period. \nYou can also select Custom to enter a specific date range. \nTap Start Date or End Date to change the date range. \nSet a  Start  and  End  date. You can tap -1 Week or +1 Week to increase by week and tap Today to select the date to today. You can also manually set a date by scrolling through the  Date Wheel . \n Tap Done to set the date. \nFrom the  Custom Date Range  screen, tap Apply when the date range is set. \nThe report refreshes. \nYou can tap the  (i)  icon on a card to learn more about each sales type. \nTap the  Filters  icon to add filters for the report. \nToggle or select Filters . \n  \n See each report's respective support article for more information on what each filter does. \nTap Run Report . \nTap the  Print  icon to print the report. \nScroll to the end of the report to see relevant data. For example, you can scroll down to the bottom of the  Sales Summary  report to see the  Revenue Total ,  Points Summaries , and the  IOUs Outstanding  summary. \n  Summary data presented depends on the selected report . \nHow to Drill Down in a Report \nNote \n The sales types that appear on individual rows in the web report are represented on \"cards\" in the mobile version. \n If a sales category has a value, there will be a right arrow on that card. Tap it to drill down to more detail for that category. Some drill-down reports may have a choice between  Business Cost  and  Total Sales , in which case you'll make that choice after tapping the arrow. \nTap a  Card  with more information available (it will show a right-arrow ( &gt; ) icon) to drill down. \nNote \n Not all reports have drill-down capability. \n \n The detail screen shows all the information for each transaction completed in the selected date range. The default is  Checkout Date  order. \nTap the  More  menu (3 vertical dots) to configure sort options or print the report. \nTap Sort By and select how you want the report sorted. You can also tap Print to print the entire report. \nNote \n The drill-down will be sorted by descending or ascending order by tapping the  descending/ascending  icon. \nTo search by date, customer, employee or item sold, click the  Search  icon, enter a search term in the box and run the search from your device's onscreen keyboard. \nWith the search function, you can search for specific services, employees, or customers to narrow down the information you want to see. The report will refresh with any search results matching your entry. \nIf the detail screen has a right-arrow ( &gt; ) icon, tap anywhere to view and print a receipt from the transaction. \nNote \n The receipt printing option is available in sales-related reports (Transaction list, Sales Summary, etc.) Other reports showing  &gt;  may go to other types of additional detail. \nFrom this screen, you can print the transaction receipt. \n  \n To learn how to print a receipt, see Print or Email a Receipt from a Past Transaction . \n",

  "name": "Sharing Between Multi-Location Business Location",
  "body": " \n With multi-location businesses, you can sync customers, points, gift cards, and more. You can share forms so templates and customer responses can be seen in all locations, and you can employee reviews will be shared across locations when an employee works in more than one of your business locations. \nPrerequisites \nMulti-location configuration is available for all Vagaro Businesses. \nForms  is an add-on available for an extra charge, see pricing information . \nIf you have a  Vagaro Branded App , you can share it between your locations. See Branded App to get started. \nWhat's in this article? \nShare Between Multiple Locations Using Groups \nMulti-Location Groups for Existing Multi-Location Businesses \nSharing Forms \nSharing Employee Reviews Between Multi-Locations \nSharing the Branded App \nShare Between Multiple Locations Using Groups \nTo share information and settings between your multi-location businesses, set up Groups and add businesses to those groups. Locations must be grouped to sync customers and information between them. You cannot share information between locations without groups and cannot share information between groups. The only exception is for the Branded App (see below) . \nSet up a Group \nClick Add and select New Group . \nEnter a Group Name and select locations to include in the group from the Select Locations drop-down list. \nUnder  Shared Settings , toggle Sync Customers on (green). \n Additional share/sync options display. \nSelect the information that will sync between all the businesses in this group, then click Save to finish. \nIf you selected  Forms , you'll see a pop-up confirmation to  Activate Forms  for any businesses that do not already have them. Agree to the monthly payment, then click Activate . \nYour new group with the businesses you've added is displayed at the end of the multi-location listings. \nImportant \n If packages and memberships being synched between multi-locations do not match up completely (Package/Membership name PLUS all services, classes, or products that are part of that package or membership), they will not be synced to the other businesses. \nStop Synching Customers \n \n When you first sync customers between businesses in a group, the customer lists for the locations are merged, resulting in both locations having the same customer lists. \n Let's use an example of two locations:  LocX  and  LocZ . Their customer lists look like this: \nAfter adding both locations to a group and turning on customer sync, each location's customer list has all the customers from both locations: \n  \n If you later turn off customer sync by editing the group or removing a location from the group, the system \"de-couples\" the customer list back to the original configuration with separate customer lists. \n  UNLESS  \n If  LocX_CustA  does business with LocZ (a service, class, or product purchase, for example) while the two are in  Multi-Location Group  and syncing customers, their profile is updated for  LocZ . If you turn off sync or take  LocZ  out of the group,  LocX_CustA  will be a customer in both locations, while the other customers will be separated into their original location customer lists. \n In this scenario, the customer lists after ending the sync will look like this: \nTo stop syncing customers : \nClick the  Group  name hyperlink or select Edit Group from the  More  menu. \nRemove locations from the group by deselecting them. \nTurn off customer sync for the group : \nToggle  Sync Customers  off: \nClick Disable in the confirmation dialog box. \nClick Save to finish editing the group. \nMulti-Location Groups for Existing Multi-Location Businesses \nIf you have already set up your business to have multiple locations, Vagaro will convert your configuration to use the new Grouping feature, copying your existing sharing settings, including handling the Branded App settings separately. \n Vagaro will create a default group named  Multi-location Group  and put your locations into it with sharing configured as it was. \nIf your Branded App was shared by all locations,  Activate Branded App for All Locations  will be selected. \nIf your Branded App was only shared between some locations,  Activate Branded App for Specific Locations  will be selected showing those locations. \nTo change any of these imported settings, edit the Group or Branded app settings on the multi-location page by clicking Edit Group from the More menu for the group. \n  \n You can change the following: \nGroup name \nSelected locations \nSync options for the group's locations \nClick Save to finish. \n Change Branded App sharing options in that section. See  Sharing the Branded App  for more information. \nSharing Forms \nCreating individual copies of forms for each multi-location business is unnecessary. Using the Share Forms switch in Settings → Business → Multi-Location , you can share forms with all locations. \nForms  - All businesses must have the  Forms  add-on enabled. \nVagaro Drive  - If any business's forms use Vagaro Drive to store files, all businesses in the group must enable Vagaro Drive to share forms. \nCredit Card Processing  - If any forms utilize the  Payment Module  to collect credit card information, all businesses must also use credit card processing. If you try to create a new form that uses the payment module after Forms sharing is turned on, you will not be able to until all businesses have credit card processing configured. \nTo Enable Forms Sharing: \nSelect a group and either click the hyperlink for the group name or select Edit Group from the  More  menu (3 vertical dots.) \nIn the  Shared Settings  section,  Sync Customers  must be toggled on (green). In this case, click Forms to select. Then you can select any additional settings to share within the group. \nClick Save to finish. \nNote \n If any of the locations in the group do not already have Forms activated, you will see a pop-up message asking you to activate Forms for the locations. Agree to the terms and click Activate . \n  \n Syncing forms between all your businesses can take up to 2 hours. \n \n Here are some reasons why enabling forms sharing might not be allowed: \nAll businesses do not have the Forms feature enabled \nAll businesses do not have Vagaro Drive enabled (when a form uses stored files/images) \nAll businesses do not use Vagaro Merchant Services (when a form uses the payment module) \nTo Disable Forms Sharing: \nReturn to the  Multi-Location  settings screen and edit the group. \nDeselect  Forms  and click Save . \nThe change to the group is saved, and the locations in the group no longer share forms. \nWith Forms Sharing  On , the following will apply: \nCreate a new form  - the new form is shared in all locations \nEdit an existing form  - changes to forms are shared in all locations \nDelete a form  - forms are ONLY deleted from the  location  that you're IN at the time of deletion \nDuplicate a form  - the duplicated form is shared in all locations \nWhat happens when forms from multiple locations are synched \n \n Generally, when you turn on form sharing for your multi-location businesses, forms in one location will be duplicated to all locations. \n \n Note \n Since Customer sharing must also be on for forms sharing, customer responses to forms will be duplicated to all locations. \n \n If a form used in two locations has the same name but different content, both forms will be duplicated to all businesses, but one form will have the business name appended to show that there was a difference. \n  Example 1:  \nForm name  \nContent  \nForm name after merge  \nLocation1 \nNew Client Form \nNew Client Form \nLocation2 \nNew Client Form \nDifferent \nNew Client Form-Location2 \nLocation3 \nCustomer Survey \nCustomer Survey \nForms in locations after sharing configured: \nLocation1 \nNew Client Form \nNew Client Form-Location2 \nCustomer Survey \nLocation2 \nNew Client Form \nNew Client Form-Location2 \nCustomer Survey \nLocation3 \nNew Client Form \nNew Client Form-Location2 \nCustomer Survey \nExample 2:  \nForm name  \nContent  \nForm name after merge  \nMyBizLoc1 \nBusiness Card Request \nNew Stylist Form \nBusiness Card Request \nNew Stylist Form \nMyBizLoc2 \nNew Stylist Form \nDifferent \nNew Stylist Form-MyBizLoc2 \nMyBizLoc3 \nIntake Form \nIntake Form \nForms in locations after sharing configured: \nMyBizLoc1 \nBusiness Card Request \nNew Stylist Form \nNew Stylist Form-MyBizLoc2 \nIntake Form \nMyBizLoc2 \nBusiness Card Request \nNew Stylist Form \nNew Stylist Form-MyBizLoc2 \nIntake Form \nMyBizLoc3 \nBusiness Card Request \nNew Stylist Form \nNew Stylist Form-MyBizLoc2 \nIntake Form \nAfter the merge and sync are complete, you can change the name of the forms that were renamed during the process. \nSharing Employee Reviews Between Multi-Locations \nWhen you have a multi-location business, with either one or several groups of locations, reviews for employees that work in more than one location are shared on the booking page for each location. If you add an employee to a new location that's part of a group, their existing reviews will be replicated on the new location's booking page. Reviews are shared throughout the entire multi-location setup, including between different groups. \nVenue vs. Staff Reviews \n \n Customer reviews are associated both with the location (venue) and the staff member that provided a service or lead a class. Here's how those reviews are shared across multiple locations: \n  Location : On your booking page, the  About  tab shows an overall rating (from all ratings in all reviews) and a link showing the number of reviews. \n  \n When a review for an employee from this location is added, the rating changes to add the latest ratings into the calculation, and the number of reviews is incremented. When a customer clicks the link to see the  location  reviews, they'll see only ones that were written for services performed at this location. \n  Employee : On the  Staff  tab of your booking page and when a customer is offered multiple employee choices when booking a service, all reviews for an employee, regardless of location, are displayed. \nWhen a new review is added for an employee who works at more than one of your locations, the overall rating changes to add the new rating into the overall calculation, and the number of reviews increments for that employee - in ALL locations. \nRemove Employee From a Location \nRemoving an employee from one location of a multi-location business has the following effect on the review pages: \nLocation/Venue Reviews \n All reviews for the location are maintained in the  About  tab, even after the employee is removed. The rating from that review is kept as part of the overall rating calculation for the location. \nEmployee Reviews \n The employee is no longer shown on the  Staff  tab. This means that reviews for the deleted employee are not shown, either. \n   However   \n An employee review written while they were in  Business B  is still shown with that employee's reviews on  Business A 's staff page. \nRemove Business from Multi-Location \nRemoving a business from a multi-location group or configuration has the following effect on the review pages: \nLocation/Venue Reviews \n All reviews for the location are maintained in the  About  tab. The rating from that review is kept as part of the overall rating calculation for the location. \nEmployee Reviews \n The employee is shown on the  Staff  for both locations after separation. The review for that employee is only displayed on the Staff page of the business that was reviewed. \nSharing the Branded App \nIf you have a Branded App from Vagaro for your business, you can share it with all or some of your locations. \nScroll down to the Branded App section of the Multi-Location page. \nSelect an option for sharing: \nActivate Branded App for All Locations . \n Immediately shares the branded app with all locations and automatically adds the app to any locations you add in the future. \nActivate Branded for Specific Locations . \n Use checkboxes to select individual locations that will share the branded app. \nClick Save . \nIf you selected  activate for all locations : \nReview the locations on the Activate Branded App pop-up confirmation. \nScroll to  Terms &amp; Conditions , accept the terms by checking the box, and click Activate to accept. \nIf you selected  activate for specific locations , you might see two pop-up confirmation screens when you click Save . \nIf locations that currently have the branded app active were not selected, you'll see a  Deactivate Branded App  pop-up confirmation listing the businesses for which it will be deactivated. Agree to the terms and click Deactivate . \nIf the Branded App will be activated for new locations, they are listed on the  Activate Branded App  pop-up confirmation. Agree to the terms and click Activate . \nClick Save again to finish. \n",

If more than one device is found, match the serial number to your device first. \nSuccess message: \nClick or tap Pay with Card . \n Canadian customers may see a selection box for either a  Credit Card  or  Interac Card . Make your selection. \nNote \n Before charging the customer's card, tip options will display on the Wise POS E. The customer can select from the selected tip options in  Checkout Settings , add a custom tip, or tap No tip . \nDip, Tap or Swipe the customer's card. \nComplete the checkout process (tip, signature, etc.) \nUnassigning a Reader \n \n When you connect a chip reader to a device, it assigns the reader to that specific device. If another business attempts to use that reader, they'll see a popup stating that the reader is assigned to another business. This means that the other business must  unassign  the reader first. Have the other business call Vagaro support to get the device unassigned. \nFirmware Updates \n \n Firmware updates keep your EMV reader compatible and current with new media. \n Stripe maintains the software that controls the WisePOS E. The reader receives updates automatically from Stripe when not in use. As reader software updates are made available, update your readers to the latest version. Failing to install a required update can prevent a reader from accepting payments. \n Leave your reader on and connected to power to receive automatic software updates. This ensures that updates happen at midnight (in the time zone of the assigned location) to avoid interruption to sales. If you unplug the reader at night, an update could start when you turn it back on. To manually check for an update, reboot the reader. \n",

  "body": " \n Vagaro to Vagaro Import services makes it easy for employees to move between two Vagaro businesses or transfer their services, classes, customers, customer notes, future appointments, and Vagaro Drive files to a new Vagaro business from their current Vagaro business. This feature gives you secure data transfer between businesses and avoids manually exporting and importing data. \n These import services support a smooth transition between Vagaro businesses in four transfer scenarios: \nScenario 1 - An employee of a Vagaro business creates their own new Vagaro business and requests a transfer of the employee's information from the old business. \nScenario 2 - An employee moving to a different Vagaro business asks the current business owner to transfer their information to the new employer (also a Vagaro business.) \nScenario 3 - A Vagaro business owner uses the  Make Owner of a New Business  option to set up a new business for their employee and transfer the employee's information in the same operation. \nScenario 4 - When a business adds a new employee, who works for another Vagaro business, they can request a transfer of the employee's information as part of configuring the new employee. \nThis article will take you through the steps for all four scenarios. Screens all show the process on the Web version of Vagaro but are the same for the Vagaro Pro app (except where noted). \n Additional information about Vagaro to Vagaro Imports in this article: \nHow Information is Handled in a Vagaro to Vagaro Import \nVagaro Drive files \nService Mapping \nImportant Considerations \nScenario 1: Employee creates their own new Vagaro business \n \n Once you've gone through the steps of creating a new Vagaro Business , follow these steps: \n  In your new Vagaro business : \nGo to Customers → Import Management . \n  Vagaro Pro : More → Settings → Import Management . \nClick Request Transfer in the notification at the top to transfer information from your current Vagaro business employer. \nNote \n You'll see more than one transfer request option if you are employed by multiple Vagaro businesses (as with a multi-location business). \nUse the checkboxes to select which information to transfer and click Request Transfer . \nIn the transferring Vagaro business:  \nThe business owner gets a notification that you want to transfer your information. \nThey approve the transfer. \nWhen the transfer is complete, the transferring business owner should delete your employee account from their business. \n \n Note \n You'll receive an email notification if the original business owner denies your transfer request. If the Request Transfer option is still available on the Customer/Import Management page, you can request the transfer again, or you can contact the original business owner directly and ask them to start the transfer process from their side. \nIn your new Vagaro business:  \nYou'll receive a notification that your information has been transferred. \nIf applicable, click the  Service Mapping  link to view services to be transferred and add new services to your business to match services at your previous Vagaro business. \n See the Service Mapping section for more information. \nImportant \n If you have transferred customer appointments to your new business, let those customers know about the change. \nScenario 2: Employee moves to a different Vagaro business \n \n The employee moving to a different Vagaro business asks the current owner to transfer their information to the new one. \n  In the transferring Vagaro business, the business owner performs these steps : \nGo to Settings → Employees → Employee Profiles . \n  Vagaro Pro : More → Settings → Employee Profiles . \nClick the  Action  menu (3 horizontal dots) to transfer and select Transfer Employee's Data . \nClick Transfer to Another Business . \nSelect the options for which information to transfer and check the  Express Consent  box. \nClick Request Transfer . \nIn the target business, the business owner performs these steps : \nClick View in the transfer notification. \nCheck the  Express Consent  box. \nClick Approve Transfer . \nIn the target business, after the transfer is approved, either the employee or business owner performs these steps : \nClick Service Mapping in the  [name] Approved Transfer  notification. \n See the Service Mapping section for more information. \nEither match the services shown to existing services or select Create New Service to create the service in the target business. \nClick Import on the Service Mapping screen when done. \nScenario 3: Business owner creates a new business and transfers employee data \n \n Employees who want to start their own Vagaro business can ask the owner of their current business to create a new business for them and transfer their data in the same operation. \n  In the transferring business, the business owner follows these steps : \nGo to Settings → Employees → Employee Profiles . \n  Vagaro Pro : More → Settings → Employee Profiles . \nClick the  …  menu by the employee to transfer and select Transfer Employee's Data . \nClick Make Owner of a New Business . \nSelect transfer options, transfer date, and check the  Express Consent  box. \nClick Create Business . \nEnter the information for the employee's new business. \nBusiness name, address, and phone. \nA credit card to use for billing in the new business. \nClick Create Business . \nThe requested data (customer contact, notes, appointments, services, and classes) is copied or moved to the new business, and the owner of the new business receives an email confirmation. \n The transferring business owner will receive a notification when the transfer is complete and should delete the employee from their business. \nScenario 4: Business owner adds a new employee from another Vagaro business \n \n When a business owner adds a new employee who already works for another Vagaro business, the business owner will be offered the option to transfer employee data to their business during the employee creation process. \n  The business owner adding a new employee follows these steps : \nGo to Settings → Employees → Employee Profiles . \n  Vagaro Pro : More → Settings → Employee Profiles . \nClick +New Employee . \nEnter employee details and click Next . \nClick Add Employee on the  Existing Employee Profile Found  pop-up notice. \nSign in as the employee you're adding. \nYou'll see a confirmation pop-up. \nThe employee is added to your business (including all profile data from the transferring business that is available.) \nClick Next . \nSet the  Employee Type  and  Access Level , and then click Next . \n If you use an employee ID card, swipe it to add to the employee data. \nSelect a business to use for data transfer and click Continue . \n  \n You will have choices of any other Vagaro business that the employee is associated with. \nSelect the data to be transferred and click Request Transfer . \nNote \n If you skip the transfer at this step, the new employee can request their former business initiate the transfer later. \nSet up the new employee's working hours on the next screen and click Next . \n You'll see a  Transfer Request has been Sent  banner. \nSelect services and classes for your new employee or let the transfer operation set those up when data is imported. \nClick Save . \nIn the transferring Vagaro business : \nThe transferring business owner gets a notification of the transfer request. \nThey approve the transfer. \nWhen the transfer is complete, the transferring business owner should delete the employee account from their business. \nNote \n If the transferring business owner denies the transfer request, the target business owner receives an email notification. They can always request the transfer again. \n \n If there are no service mappings to consider, the target business owner is notified that the transfer request was approved. \nHow Information is Handled in a Vagaro to Vagaro Import \n \n Depending on what information is included in a transfer request, here's how the transfer is handled: \nData  \nMoved to Target Business  \nCopied to Target Business  \nFuture Appointments \nAppointment Files (Vagaro Drive) \nCustomer Contact Information \nCustomer Notes \nCustomer Files (Vagaro Drive) \nServices \nClasses \nNote \n When data is   moved   to the target business, it is deleted from the transferring business. \nVagaro Drive files \n \n If the transferring business has files on Vagaro Drive, transfer options for Appointment and Customer files on Vagaro Drive are offered but are not checked with other options. Select the ones you want to transfer. \n  \n When the target business is approving the transfer, if they do not have Vagaro Drive enabled or might not have enough storage to add the transferred files, the business owner will see this pop-up notification asking them if they want to add Vagaro Drive (or add more storage to their plan.) \nService Mapping \n \n When a Vagaro to Vagaro transfer involves services for both businesses, the employee or business owner of the target business will receive a notice to review service mapping. This process helps align differences between two businesses' services. \n  \n The Service Mapping screen shows a list of all services in the transferring business and drop-down selection menus for the target business to use to match up service \"a\" (transferring business) to service \"b\" (target business). Where the services already match, the list will contain the matching service. The target business owner or employee can change that match if wanted. If a transferred service has no match in the target business, the drop-down will offer to Create New Service, the default option. This option will create a new service in the target business to match the transferring business. \nWhen the transferring business owner creates a new business for their employee (Scenario 3), services and classes are imported without mapping. \nIf the target business has no services or classes configured, those in the transferring business will be imported without mapping. \nImportant Considerations \nContact customers : Employees moving appointments to a different or new (their own) Vagaro business must contact their customers with appointments to inform them of the change. \nInactive or suspended target business : If you request the transfer to occur on a date in the future, be aware that if the target business becomes inactive or suspended (due to non-payment, for example), the transfer will not go through. \nFree trial vs. paying businesses : In Scenario 3, where the transferring business owner is creating a new business for their employee, the following applies: \nIf the transferring business is in a  free trial period , the target business they create will start a free trial period. \nIf the transferring business is in a  paid monthly plan , the target business they create will immediately be in a paid plan with no free trial period. \n The new business can avoid this if the employee creates their own new business and transfers the data. (Scenario 1) \nCancellation : Once initiated, you cannot cancel or back out of a transfer request. If you make a mistake, contact Vagaro Support for options to roll back a transfer.  Requests to roll back a completed Vagaro to Vagaro import may incur a service fee.  \n",

Move forms from paper copies to digital files, accessible to you from anywhere. You can even link customer files to a specific appointment so the service provider can quickly access them during an appointment. \nPrerequisites \n \n If you haven't activated your Vagaro Drive yet, follow the directions in Activate Vagaro Drive . \nWhat's in this article? \nAccess your Vagaro Drive (follows) \nNavigating the Vagaro Drive Dashboard \nUploading Files to your Vagaro Drive \nFiltering, Sorting, and Searching Vagaro Drive \nManaging your Files \nUpload Customer Files from the Customer Profile or Calendar \nHow do I use this? \nAccess your Vagaro Drive \nGo to Settings → Add-ons → Vagaro Drive . \n If you've already activated Vagaro Drive, you'll go right to your Dashboard. Otherwise, see the support article on  Activating Vagaro Drive  to sign up. \nNavigating the Vagaro Drive Dashboard \nSidebar Navigation  \n On the left side of your screen, you'll see the main controls for Vagaro Drive. Options shown there are: \n  Upload button  \n  \n This drop-down menu gives you options to upload three types of files: \nAppointment Files (associate files with specific appointments for individual customers) \nCustomer Files (customer-related files that are not connected to appointments) \nBusiness Files (your business files, e.g., lease agreements, employee files, etc.) \nFolder Groups  \n Vagaro Drive stores files in four areas divided between  Customer  and  Business  sections. Under Customers, you'll find the Appointment and Customer files that you've uploaded.  Forms Files  contains all files uploaded to a form (created under the Forms tab.) \n  Storage Summary  \n A summary of your used and available file storage. Click View Plan Storage for a detailed view of how the four file areas use your storage. \n  \n You can add or change your Vagaro Drive storage plan at any time by clicking Change Plan , which opens a dialog showing the details of how you're using your file storage, highlighting which plan you are currently on, and offering options to buy more storage (10GB, 50GB, or 100GB). \n  \n From this dialog box, you can remove all storage and close your Vagaro Drive add-on. \n Click Remove All Storage , and agree to the terms of canceling your storage plan. See Activate Vagaro Drive for more information. \nUploading files to your Vagaro Drive \nCustomer files and files associated with customer appointments cannot be shared with your customers via your Vagaro Drive. They are for internal business use only. If you have a file that you want to share with your customers, download a copy from your Vagaro Drive to send using email or other file-sharing options. \nClick Upload and select the type of upload: \nFor  Appointment  files, select a customer, then an appointment in the past or future, and click Next . \nFor  Customer  files, select a customer and click Next . \nFor  Business  files, go directly to the next step. \nThe upload screen looks the same for all three upload types. \n This example shows the  Customer File  upload screen: \nDrag and drop files onto the upload area or click Choose File to search for a file or files to upload. \nYou can edit the file name and add a description to the file or files you've selected. \n  \n You can also remove selected files from the upload queue by clicking the red trash can icon. \nClick Upload . \n If there are many files, you'll see progress indicators and checkmarks as each file is uploaded. \nThere are three additional places from which you can upload files to your Vagaro Drive: \nClick a service appointment on the calendar (past or future) and select Upload File from the list to add files to the appointment. \nGo to Customers → Manage Customers , and select a customer. Click the   menu from the Appointments tab and then select Upload Files . This action also adds files to the appointment. \nGo to Customers → Manage Customers , and select a customer. Go to the  Files  tab to upload files to appointments or customer files on your Vagaro Drive. \nFiltering, Sorting, and Searching Vagaro Drive \nEach file section has options for filtering and sorting your view of the files and a  Search  option. Filtering and sorting options are different for each section. \n  Filter - Appointment &amp; Customer Files  \n You can filter on  Appointment Date  ( Upload Date  for Customer Files) and  Customer Name . \nThe  Appointment/Upload Date  field defaults to  All Dates . \n Click it to select a date range or choose a pre-defined date setting like Last 30 Days , for example. Set a date range and then select Submit . \nCustomer Name : Select a customer from the drop-down list using checkboxes, the Select All or Select None options, or start typing a name into the text box to limit the list. If you make no selection, it will look for all customer appointments in the selected date range. \nClick View Results when you've made your selections. \nClick Clear to reset the filters to their default settings. \nFilter - Forms Files  \n Filter on  Form Date  (the date the form was completed),  Customer Name , and  Form Name . \nDate selection ( Form Date , in this case) and  Customer Name  work the same as for  Appointments . \nForm Name : Select a form from the drop-down list using checkboxes, the  Select All  or  Select None  options, or start typing a form name into the text box to limit the list. If you make no selection, it will look for all forms in the selected date range. \nClick View Results to see the filtered list. \nClick Clear to reset the filters to their default settings. \nFilter - Business Files  \n The only available filter is for  Upload Date , and it works the same as the other date filters. \n  Sorting the File List - Grid View  \n This view shows a thumbnail view of the files. (Not all file types support a thumbnail preview. Those files will display a file type icon.) \n The Grid view displays file names and dates (upload or appointment dates) under the thumbnail. \n To sort the files in Grid view, use the  Sort by  drop-down list. The selections available match the columns shown in the list view. Select one to sort the files. When sorted, the sort type displays with an up or down arrow to indicate the sort direction. \n  \n  Sorting the File Lists - List View  \n This view shows smaller thumbnails where possible and a section-dependent list of file information. These are the information columns for each file area: \nAppointment Files  \nFile Name \nFile Type \nCustomer Name \nAppointment Name \nEmployee Name \nAppointment Date \nUpload Date \nCustomer Files  \nFile Name \nFile Type \nCustomer Name \nUpload Date \nForms Files  \nFile Name \nForm Name \nFile Type \nUpload Date \nBusiness Files  \nFile Name \nFile Type \nUpload Date \nYou can use each column header in the list view to sort. When you set a column as the sort column, you'll see an up or down arrow indicating the sort direction. \n  \n  Searching the Files  \n There is a  Search  box in each file section. Type in all or part of a file name to search the list for matches. \nManaging your Files \nNote \n The  Files  tab of the  Customer Profile  uses the same functionality and interface for  Appointment  and  Customer  files as Vagaro Drive. \n \n Each file has a  More  menu, either embedded in the thumbnail (grid view) or as the last column (list view). Click the  More  menu to open the list of file management options: \nOpen : opens a view of the file with a sidebar of file information (see  Info below.) \n You can also click the thumbnail (Grid or List view) or the file name (List view) to open and view the file or image. \nIn this view, there are additional icons to edit image files, download or delete the file, open or close the info panel, and close the view. Arrows ( &lt; or &gt; ) on each side let you scroll through the files. \nVagaro Drive can preview images, PDF, text (.txt), Word (.doc, .docx), and Excel (xls, .xlsx) files. You must download PowerPoint (.ppt, .pptx), Word RTF, and video (.mpg and .mov) files to view. \nRename : opens a sidebar to rename the file and enter or change the file description. \nDownload  \nInfo : opens the same info menu as Open, Rename and Edit Description, but without any edit capabilities. \n The file information provided in this and the editable version varies depending on the file section you are in and the file type. Here is the complete list of all possible information items: \nFile Name \nDescription \nCustomer Name \nAppointment Date * \nService Name \nEmployee \nAppointment Note \nUploaded by \nUpload Date \nFile Type \nDimensions \nSize \nForm Name * \nNote \n Both  Appointment Date  and  Form Name  are hyperlinks that will take you to the appointment on the  Calendar  page or opens a pop-up window for the  Form  where you can perform all the same actions that you would on the  Forms  or  SOAP  tabs on the customer's profile. \nEdit Description : opens the same sidebar as  Rename , where you can rename the file and enter or change the file description. \nDelete  \nUpload Customer Files from the Customer Profile or Calendar \nYou can add files for customers using the Vagaro Drive Dashboard, the customer's profile, or the Calendar when booking an appointment. \n  Customer Profile  \nGo to Customers → Customer Management and select a customer. \nSelect the  Files  tab from the options: \n  \n The  Files  interface matches what you'll see on your Vagaro Drive Dashboard without the Business Files section. \nUse Upload to add appointment or customer files or to look through the existing files. \nNote \n See Uploading files to your Vagaro Drive in this article. \n \n You have the same view options of  Grid  and  List  views as on your dashboard and can manage file information from this page. \nFrom the Calendar  \nBook a New Appointment \nIn the field for entering an  Appointment Note , there is also a place to add files. \nDrag and drop or select files to add to the appointment. \n \n Note \n See Uploading files to your Vagaro Drive in this article. \n \n You'll see uploaded files in the  Customer Files  area in your Vagaro Drive Dashboard. \n",

Doing so may cause the scheduled class or service to become out of sync with the Zoom meeting. \n If you need to reschedule the class or service, please schedule it on Vagaro and the Zoom meeting will be updated accordingly. \nActivating or Deactivating Zoom Integration \nClick Settings . \nSelect Integrations , under the  Add-Ons  section. \nClick Learn More underneath the Zoom logo. This is where you can learn more about the activation and activate it. \nTo enable the integration, click Activate . \nA pop-up sign in screen displays. Log in to your Zoom account or create one. Once you are logged in successfully, the integration will be set up. \n  \n If you need to deactivate the Zoom integration, you can do so from the same page you activated the integration on. Follow the steps above to get to the page, then click Deactivate . \n \n Note \n If you have a merchant account, prepayment is required for all live stream classes and services as a way to protect your business and ensure that you get paid. \nSetting Up Individual Streaming Accounts \n \n If your Zoom integration is enabled, you can still share your Zoom login credentials among multiple staff members without taking further action, so long as your staff doesn’t live stream multiple classes or sessions at the same time. \n To enable multiple live streams at the same time, set each staff member up as a licensed Zoom host with separate log-in credentials within your Zoom account, or alternatively, each staff member can sign up for their own Zoom account. \n Once staff members have been set up as licensed Zoom hosts, they can be activated in Vagaro following the process outlined below: \nOn the Zoom integration page, a list of employees is shown towards the bottom of the page, with an  Activate  button displayed next to each name. When an employee is ready to link their Zoom account, they can click the  Activate  button. \nA pop-up sign in screen displays, prompting the employee to enter their Zoom login credentials. They will also have the option to sign up if they do not have their own account. \n  \n Once the activation is complete, the  Activate  button will be replaced by the  Deactivate  button. The email address each employee uses for their Zoom login will show next to the button. \n  \n Now multiple employees can live stream services and classes at the same time without it interfering with other providers and their calendars. \nNote \n Clicking Update Now is not required to add individual instructor accounts. Clicking it will simply improve the performance of the integration and give you access to the newest integration features. \nSetting up a Service with Zoom Streaming \nClick Settings . \nSelect the  Service / Class Menu  from the menu on the left side of the page. Then select the  Services  tab. \nYou can select an existing service or create a new service. When creating a new service, you can select from our list of Vagaro services or add your own by choosing the custom service option. \nTo enable the streaming capability, toggle Live Stream on (green.) \nWhen done editing the service, click Save . \n The service will now be offered as a live stream. \nNote \n Making a service live stream will only apply to future bookings. \nSetting up a Class with Zoom Streaming \nClick Calendar and select an empty time slot on the Calendar to create a new class or hover over an existing class to edit it. \nWhen editing or adding a class to the calendar, you will see entry fields for In-house Capacity and Live Stream Capacity . These choices limit how many can join the class in-house or by live stream. \nBy entering in the number of attendees in  Live Stream Capacity , you have activated the live stream option for this class. You can have live stream only classes, in-house only classes, or a hybrid of both in-house and live stream classes depending on the number of attendees you enter in each box. \nDifferent prices for in-house attendees vs. live stream attendees can be set. You can do this from the Service/Class menu. \nClick the class from the Calendar and hover over Add Attendee to add customers to a live-streamed class. From here, you can add either Live Stream or In House attendees. \n Click Live Stream , and you will then be prompted to select the attendees being added. \nNote \n When you look at a class on the Calendar screen, you can see the number of attendees; hover over the circles to see the number of in-house or live-stream attendees. \nHow to Start Your Live Stream for a Service or Class \nNote \n You must create all appointments and classes in Vagaro, and start the live streams for all appointments and classes in Vagaro. \nNote \n You cannot start a Live Stream class any earlier than 10 minutes before the scheduled start time. \nClick Calendar . You can see which classes and services are live streamed by the video camera icon. \nClick the appointment you want to begin the live stream for. \nSelect Start Service (Live Stream Video) or Start Class (Live Stream Video) to begin the live stream. \nThis will open Zoom in a new tab and you’ll be able to begin the service or class via the live stream. You can live stream from a computer or a mobile device. \nOnce the live stream has been completed, you can access the recording shortly after in Vagaro. On the Calendar, click an appointment or class and select Edit . Then click Live Stream and a new page will open where you can watch the recording. \nTip \n There are a few useful tools that you can use during your live stream. \nIf your clients don’t need to speak or if you have multiple attendees with distracting background noise, use the  Mute All  button to keep everyone focused \nThere is also a  Chat  feature that allows you to send messages directly to a client, or to your entire group of attendees \nWith the  Share Content  button you can share images or files, which can be helpful if you are going over detailed information or need to share a document \nLive Stream Search \n \n Once you have set up your live stream services and classes, it's time to get booked! Vagaro offers a live stream search so clients all over the world can see live and upcoming virtual classes from businesses across the United States. \n  \n For your live stream class to show in the search, you must have an active Vagaro Merchant Services account. The ability to be featured in the live stream search is free during the introductory period. Clients can filter all live streams by name/type, date, and duration, or find live streams for their bookmarked businesses. \nHow to Track Registrants and Attendees \n \n On the calendar screen, you can see the attendees that are registered to join your class by selecting the  Edit  button. Services will be listed on the calendar just like all other appointments, and the video icon will be shown for those appointments that will be live streamed. You can also utilize the Services/Classes report to track the number of attendees that were checked out for a class. \n",

To check your Payroll settings in Vagaro, go to the Payroll Configuration page. \nClick Reports and then click Payroll Configuration . \nOn the  Payroll Configuration  page, verify that  Payroll Frequency ,  Day of the Week , and  Payroll Ending Day  are all correct. \nAfter verifying in Vagaro, verify it in  Gusto . \n You can do this from the  Company Details  page. \nOn the  Company Details  page, select the  Edit  button next to  Pay Schedule . \nFrom the small window, select the same  Pay Period ,  Day of the Week , and  Payroll Ending Day  that you have in Vagaro. \nYou must also select the  First Pay Day on New Schedule  and select on which dates the work was done to be included in this pay period. \nIf the information matches, your sync issues should resolve on their own. If your Payroll ends on a Saturday or Sunday, this will not align with the settings in Gusto. Gusto doesn't offer Saturday or Sunday paydays because most banks do not process payments over the weekend. \n If you already have your Payroll end date in Vagaro set to Saturday or Sunday, you can manually sync your Payroll settings. \nIn Gusto, select the same  Payroll Frequency  you selected in Vagaro. For  Day of the week , select Monday. \nSelect Other on the  For Work Done  drop-down list, and then select the  Payroll Ending Date  that you have entered in Vagaro. \nClick Save . \nWhen you go back to Vagaro, the error message should have cleared.

  "body": " \n To add your  Branded App  to the  Apple Store  so customers can download it, you must first create an  Apple Developer Account , pay a $99 publisher fee (charged annually,) and invite Vagaro to join your account. \nWhat's in this Article? \nBefore you begin . \nSubmit an enrollment request . \nConfirm enrollment and submit payment information . \nInvite Vagaro to join your account . \nFrequently Asked Questions . \nBefore you begin \n \n Apple’s app guidelines require that the business owner complete the signup steps and submit the required information to register for their developer program. \n The Apple Developer Program requires an annual enrollment fee of $99 USD, which is not included in your Vagaro payments. \n To ease the process, we recommend completing the following steps before registering for an Apple Developer Account: \nSet up a publicly accessible business website with a domain name reflective of your business name. For example \n   https://www.vagaro.com/studio123 \n   https://www.studio123.com \nSet up a business email address connected to your domain name. \n Apple does not accept Gmail or other personal email addresses. For example: \n    studio123@gmail.com \n    info@studio123.com \nRegister your business as a legal entity. \n See Legal Entity Guidelines for Apple Developer Accounts . \nObtain a D-U-N-S number for your business. \n A D-U-N-S Number (short for Data Universal Numbering System) is a unique numeric identifier assigned to a business to verify the business’s identity and legal status. If your business is registered as a legal entity, you may already have a DUNS Number. \nTo register for a D-U-N-S number: https://developer.apple.com/support/D-U-N-S/ \nTo look up a D-U-N-S number: https://developer.apple.com/enroll/duns-lookup/#!/search \nSet up an Apple ID and enable 2-factor authentication: \n https://www.appleid.apple.com/account \n The Apple ID used when registering for the Apple Developer Program will be the same Apple ID used for billing, login, and other important communications about your developer account. For this reason, you may want to consider creating an Apple ID specifically for your business. \nSubmit an enrollment request \nGo to https://www.developer.apple.com/programs/enroll , \nClick Start Your Enrollment , then sign in with your Apple ID and password. \nSelect Company/Organization in the entity type drop-down box and click Continue . \n \n Important \n Per Apple’s requirements, you must register as a Company/Organization. Registering as an Individual will prevent you from being able to grant Vagaro access to important account settings, meaning we will be unable to upload or manage your Branded App. \nEnter your legal entity name and D-U-N-S number exactly as shown on your D-U-N-S registration. \n If an error occurs,  do not register as an individual account  . Instead: \nDouble-check that the legal entity name is entered with the exact spelling, punctuation, and capitalization as your D-U-N-S registration. \nDouble-check that the D-U-N-S Number was entered correctly. \nClick the link in the error message to update your information with the D&amp;B DUNS database, then try again in a few days. It can take up to a whole week for D&amp;B to update the database with Apple. \nComplete the remaining fields that did not auto-populate based on your legal entity and D-U-N-S information. \n The Tax ID/National ID box is optional. \nConfirm that you have legal signing authority for your business. \n Based on your selection, Apple will contact you or a senior employee at your business to verify your enrollment. \nClick Continue . \nReview your information for accuracy, then click Submit . \n You will immediately get an email verifying that Apple has received your enrollment request. Apple is now reviewing your information and will send another email after they have finished verifying your enrollment. \nConfirm enrollment and submit payment information \n \n After Apple has finished verifying your registration information, an enrollment acceptance email will be sent to the Apple ID used in the initial signup steps. \n Click Review Now , then follow the prompts to complete your developer program payment. \n \n Tip \n Opting in to auto-renew will keep your Developer Program registration current. Failure to renew your Developer Program registration will result in Apple removing your app from the App Store. \nInvite Vagaro to join your account \n \n As the last step in setting up your Apple Developer Account, you’ll need to invite Vagaro to join your account and publish your branded app on your behalf. \nGo to https://www.appstoreconnect.apple.com/access/users and log in, \nClick the blue  +  button. \nComplete the New User form with this information: \n  First Name : Vagaro \n  Last Name : Design \n  Email : appdesign@vagaro.com \nIn the Roles section, select the  Admin  checkbox. \nIn the Additional Resources section, verify that  Access to Certificates ,  Identifiers , and  Profiles  are checked. \n This access is required, as Vagaro cannot upload or manage your app without it. If Access to Certificates, Identifiers, and Profiles is not listed under  Additional Resources , contact Apple Developer Support to edit your account type: https://developer.apple.com/contact/submit \nClick Invite . \nApple will send an email invitation to the Vagaro Design Team, who will accept the invite within 1 business day. The Vagaro Design Team will verify the account permissions and notify you if there are any remaining action items regarding your Apple Developer Account. \nFrequently Asked Questions \n \n  What is a D-U-N-S number?  \n The D-U-N-S Number is a unique nine-digit number that identifies each physical location of your business. It is widely used as a standard business identifier and is provided by Dun &amp; Bradstreet (D&amp;B). For more information, click here . \n  Can I sign up as an individual instead of an organization?  \n Apple does not currently allow individual accounts to add additional users and grant them access to Certificates, Identifiers, and Profiles. This access is required for the Vagaro team to upload your Branded App to your account, so for a Vagaro Branded App, you must register as an Organization. \n  How much does it cost to enroll in the Apple Developer Program?  \n To sign up for the Apple Developer Program, you must pay a $99 (USD) annual publisher fee, which Apple charges. This fee is the same for individual and organizational accounts and is paid yearly. \n",

That means fewer missed, failed, or unnecessary payments. \n The Rent Collection feature is intuitive, free, and gives you options to: \nSet rent amounts for each employee/booth renter \nSet frequency and day of the week to collect rent payments or tie rent payments to your payroll schedule \nDeduct commissions from rent \nHave employees use their bank account (ACH, available in the US only) or credit card for payment \nSet up a backup payment method \nRequire signing a rental contract as part of the employee setup \nProvide 1099-MISC forms to renters \nPrerequisites \n \n You must have credit card processing enabled to collect rent payments. \nNavigation \n \n This article covers the following: \nConfigure Rent Collection \nAdd Renters \nAdditional Information \nConfigure Rent Collection \nNavigate to Settings → Employees → Rent Collection . \n  \n If you haven't activated Rent Collection for your business yet, the first thing you'll see will be the sales information page with a  Get Started - Free  button that you click to activate Rent Collection. \nOnce you've activated Rent Collection, your first page will be the settings page with a  Deactivate  button to use if you want to stop using the feature. \nYou can  Deduct Commission from Rent  by toggling the switch to  On . \n After toggling Deduct Commission from Rent on, the system deducts employee commissions from the rent due, and they pay the difference. \n Click  OK  in the pop-up confirmation dialog. \n  \n Toggling Deduct Commission from Rent syncs the rent collection date to your payroll and cannot be changed. \nIf you're not using  Deduct Commission from Rent , set up the frequency for collecting rent payments. \n Choices for  Charge Frequency  are: \n  \n With  Weekly  and  Every Other Week , you can select the day of the week to process the charge. \nWith  Twice A Month  frequency, the renter is charged on the 15 th and last day of each month. \n  \n For  Monthly  frequency, the charge is processed on the last day of each month. \nSet the  Next Rent Collection Date . \n Available dates depend on which  Charge Frequency  you've set. \n \n Note \n The  Next Rent Collection Date  defaults to the next available day. If you set the day of the week to Monday ON a Monday, the next date will default to the following Monday. If you set it to Tuesday on a Monday, the collection will start the next day. \nToggle Require Rent Contract if you want them to sign a rental agreement as part of the process. \n  \n  Vagaro Forms  is required to use this feature and has a built-in Rental Contract form for you to use, or you can create your own rental form. \nSelect the  Payment Method : \nSelect Bank Account or Credit Card for the  Primary Payment Method . \nIf you require renters to provide a  Backup Payment Method , toggle the switch to  On . \nAdd  Renters . \n See the next section. \nClick Save . \nNote \n You can disable recurring rent for all employees anytime by toggling the switch off. If you disable rent, you must confirm on the  Disable Recurring Rent  dialog box. Employee payment information is saved until you manually delete it. \nAbout Payment Methods \n \n The business must have credit card processing enabled for rent payments. \n  Bank Account  \nACH transactions from a renter's bank account are only available in the United States \nThere is a 1% transaction fee charged for all ACH transactions \nDeposits via ACH can take up to 7 days to reach your account \nFor employees using Vagaro's credit card processing, their bank account information will be used, or they can change it \nCredit Card  \nThe fee for credit card transactions depends on the type of merchant account \nDeposits for credit card transactions take up to 2 days to reach your account \nAdd Renters \n \n Add Renters to the table on the  Rent Collection  page to charge them rent. \nClick Add Renter . \nSelect a renter from the drop-down list. \nEnter the amount of rent to charge. \nSelect Request Your Renter Completion or Fill Payment Information . \n Selecting Request Renter Completion sends an email and a notification to the employee. \n  \n You can select Fill Payment Information if you have the renter with you. \nClick Save or Send Request . \nAbout Payment Date Timing \n If a business sends out a request for information to a service provider, ex. Sep 1, and then the service provider does not fill out the information until Sep 10 and misses the weekly rent payment date of Sep 6. When the service provider fills out their information on Sept 10, they'll also be charged on that day for the missed rent of Sep 6. And after their payment will be taken on the regular rent cycle on Sep 13. \n  Note:  If the business  changes  the rent charge frequency, unpaid rent from renters with \"Pending Request\" status will not be collected. \n \n The  Add Renter  screen will show the following: \nFor  Request Renter Completion , the request will include: \nPrimary payment method (bank account or credit card) \nBackup payment method (bank account or credit card) – if configured \nRent Contract - if required \nFor  Fill Payment Information : \nPrimary payment method to fill in (bank account or credit card) \nBackup payment method to fill in (bank account or credit card) – if configured \nIf you require a  Rent Contract , the  Fill Payment Information  screen will show that the contract will be available for the renter to sign in their profile under  Rent Collection . \nAdditional Information \nPause Rent Collection \nYou can suspend rent collection for employees from the Rent Collection page for renters who have provided their payment information. \nSelect a renter from the list, click the action menu, and select Pause Rent . \nClick Pause on the confirmation box. \nThe Status for that renter now shows  Paused . \n To resume collecting rent, click Resume Rent on the same action menu. \nBack Rent \n When you pause and resume rent collection, the renter is charged for any rent that was due during the pause. To prevent the collection of back rent, choose  Remove From Rent . \n To resume collecting rent from an employee who has been removed from rent, you will have to re-add the employee to your Renters list complete with providing new payment information and asking them to sign a new Rental Agreement (if used.) \nEmployee Profile – Rent Collection tab \nWith the  Manage Own Profile  access level set on, employees can click the  Rent Collection  tab on their profile. There, employees can also view a table with their rent payment history. \nNavigate to Settings → Employees → Employee Profiles ., and click the  Profile  button for an employee. \nClick the  Rent Collection  tab. \n  \n The first portion of the screen shows the rent amount, charge frequency, and the next rent collection date. \n \n Note \n If you haven't set up a rent option for the renter yet, click Charge Recurring Rent to start the process. \nIf the employee has not yet signed their rental contract, it shows as  Pending,  displaying the entire contract with a signature box at the end. \nIf the employee has signed the contract online, the screen displays a hyperlink with the signing date to view the contract with the signature. \nPayment Method  shows the bank account and credit card information on file for the rent payments (one or both, depending on whether a backup payment method is required.) \n  \n To remove a renter's credit card or bank information, click the  Action  menu (3 vertical dots) and select Remove from Rent . \n  \n This action completely removes all payment methods and rent charges for the employee. Only their payment history remains. Add the employee to Rent Collection again to get new payment information. \nCollect Failed Rent Payments \nThe system notifies the business owner and renter if a rent payment fails. The business owner receives an email and on-screen notification; the renter receives an email, text, and on-screen notification. \n The business owner can collect payment from two screens:  Employee Profile  &gt;  Rent Collection  page or the  Rent Collection  report. \n  \n The following steps work from both options: \nClick Collect Payment from the  More  menu. \nIn the  Collect Payment  pop-up screen, select a new payment method. \n For example, you can edit the payment amount to add a fee. \n  \n Select Cash , Check , or enter new credit card information. \nClick Collect . \n The renter can pay the rent due by credit card, either from the notification or email they receive. Both open the  Pay by Credit Card  pop-up. \nClick Pay by Credit Card in the email or View in the on-screen notification regarding the failed payment. \nSelect a saved credit card or enter a new one. (If entering a new credit card, you can select to save it to your profile.) \nClick Pay . \nAccess Levels for Rent Collection \nFor employees to manage the Rent Collection tab on their Profile, enable Manage Own Profile on the access level for the employee type. \nNavigate to Settings → Employees → Access Levels . \nClick the  More  menu (3 vertical dots) on the employee type, and click Edit . \nScroll to Settings (the last section) and set  Manage Own Profile  to Modify . \nChange the Manage Employee Rent Collection setting to allow employees to view or modify rent. \nClick Save . \nReports \nThe following reports show  Rent Collection : \nEmployees / Rent Collection \nSales / Transaction List \nAdded column and summary screen entry for  Bank Account  \nAdded  Transaction Type  filter for  Rent Collection  \nSales / Sales Summary - rows for  Rent Collection  and  Commissions (Deducted from Rent Collection)  \nSales / Trends - columns for  Projected Rent  and  Rent Charge  \nSales / Combined Report - rows for  Rent Collection  and  Commissions (Deducted from Rent Collection)  \nEmployees / Payroll - column for  Rent Collection  \nEmployees / Payroll History - column for  Rent Collection  \nTo run the  Rent Collection  report: \nNavigate to Reports → Rent Collection . \nThe report's date range defaults to the current month to date.

  "name": "About Surcharges and Convenience Fees",
  "body": " \n Let's talk about surcharges, convenience fees, and cash discounts and what is supported for your business to implement. The only one that Vagaro supports is Discount for Cash. \n \n Important \n Do NOT use Fees to implement a  Discount for Cash  as that will cause you to be in violation of Card Brand rules. \nDefinitions \n \n  Processing fee:  The charge to process a payment card transaction - usually something like 3.0% + 15¢ per transaction. Example: If you process a charge for $10.00, the processor deducts $.30 (3%) and then another $.15 and deposits $9.55 to your account. \n  Surcharge : A Surcharge is a small fee that merchants add to credit card transactions to cover their payment processing costs. (Legal restrictions and Network Rules may apply. Vagaro Merchant Services does not currently support surcharges). \n  Convenience fee : A fee added to non-face-to-face transactions only for offering an alternate payment channel to the normal payment method. (Not applicable for Vagaro merchants.) \n  Minimum Transaction Amount : A merchant can set a minimum credit card purchase amount. \nMust post signage at the entrance and the point of sale. \nOnly applicable to credit card transactions. \nCannot be applied to debit card or prepaid card transactions. \nCannot exceed $10. \nCash Discount : The merchant sets their prices for goods and services to cover their cost to provide the products and services (including the processing fees they incur for payment card transactions). This is the price displayed to the consumer. The merchant can then offer a discount to the consumer for paying with cash. \nWhat you can't do with Vagaro \n \n Vagaro cannot process surcharges or convenience fees through our system, so we do not support using either of those options. \nWhat you can do - Discount for Cash! \n \n If you wish to specifically pass processing costs on to your customers, your option, at this time, is to offer a discount to your customers at checkout when paying with cash. \n To do this, you would consider your total cost of a product or service, including the cost of payment processing, and set your pricing to cover all your costs plus your required profit margin. Then you can offer a discount to a customer paying with cash as you deem appropriate. \n If you choose to offer a discount to customers paying with cash, you must post signage at the entrance to your business and at the point of sale indicating that you offer a cash discount. \n Vagaro offers the ability to create  Preset Discounts  that can be applied at checkout. Remember that you must do this for every service, class, and product you sell! Alternatively, use the discount box on the checkout screen to deduct the amount you have determined is appropriate for your business. \n",

  "body": " \n With the  Other Payment Methods  feature, you can record payments from alternative methods, like Alle Points and Care Credit. All transactions made with additional payment methods will be listed in your  Transaction List ,  Sales Summary , and  Payment Distribution Report . \n  Related Articles : \nCheck Out a Customer - Web Version \nCheck Out a Customer - Vagaro Pro app \nSign up for Credit Card Processing \nThis article will cover the following : \nCreating a New Payment Method \nCheck Out using Other Payment Methods \nEdit or Delete an Additional Payment Method \nRefunds \nReporting \nPlease Read Before Continuing \n This feature is for reporting purposes only. You must collect and confirm payments yourself. If any  Other Payment Methods  are not verified or collected by you, Vagaro's reporting will not reflect that. \nCreating a New Payment Method \n \n Remember: This article will use web screenshots because screens are similar between the web and Vagaro Pro app versions of Vagaro. \nVagaro Pro app: Navigate to More → Settings → Taxes &amp; Checkout . \nWeb Version: Navigate to Settings → Things We Sell → Taxes &amp; Checkout . \nScroll down to the  Other Payment Methods  section, then select Add Payment Method . \nEnter a name in the  Payment Method Name  field. \n  \n This name will be used during checkout and for reporting, so please enter a name similar to the payment method you accept to avoid confusion—for example, Care Credit and Alle Points. \nClick/tap Save . \nClick/tap Save again on the  Taxes &amp; Checkout  page to finalize any changes. \nThe new payment method will now display in the  Payment Method Name  section. \nCheck Out using Other Payment Methods \nVagaro Pro app: Tap Checkout . \n  \n Web Version: Click Checkout . \n  \n Or click/tap an existing appointment on the  Calendar , then select Checkout . ( Skip to step 3 if you choose this method ) \nSelect a customer and add any items to the cart. \nClick/tap Add next to  Other . \nEnter a dollar amount into the  Amount  field. This amount can be split between multiple additional payment options or just one. \nNote \n You can also add a new payment method from this screen. \nClick/tap Save . \nEnter any additional payment information needed (if applicable,) then click/tap Checkout . \nAdditional Information: \nFor  Quickbooks  and  Xero  integration,  Other Payment Methods  will sync as \"Other Amount Payment,\" there will not be individual rows of payment methods, like Care Credit and Alle Points. \nYou can split additional payment methods with credit cards, Vagaro Pay Later, cash, IOUs, and more. \nClick/tap the boxes below for more information. \nEdit or Delete an Additional Payment Method \nRemember that you can only create up to five  Other Payment Methods . You must delete an existing payment method if you are at the limit. Deletion will not affect any reporting or previous transactions. \n To edit or delete  Other Payment Methods , follow the steps below. \nVagaro Pro app: Tap the payment method you want to edit/delete, then select Edit or Delete . \n  \n Web Version: Click the  Action  (3 vertical dots) menu for the payment method you want to edit/delete, then select Edit or Delete . \nTo edit, change the payment method name, then click/tap Save . \nTo delete, click/tap Delete again to confirm. \nClick/tap Save again on the  Taxes &amp; Checkout  page to finalize any changes. \nDeleting a payment method and creating a new one with the same name (must be spelled the same) will merge the two in reporting. \nRefunds \nRefunds requested for items purchased with additional payment methods can be split between cash, gift certificates, and  Other Payment Methods . Also, You can only refund the additional payment methods used, even if you have multiple additional methods configured. If a transaction was split between multiple additional payment options, you cannot refund the entire transaction with one payment method other than  Cash  or  Gift Certificates . If you do so outside of the Vagaro service, Vagaro's reporting will not reflect that change. \n  Example One:  \n If a $50 shampoo bottle was paid for with $30  cash  and $20  Care Credit , you have the following options for a refund: \nRefund the transaction with the same distribution \nA full refund with cash \nSplit between cash, gift certificate, and Care Credit \nHowever, you  CANNOT  refund this transaction split between  Alle Points  and  cash . \n  Example Two:  \n If a $20 shampoo bottle was paid for with $10 Alle Points and $10 Credit Card, you have the following options for a refund: \nRefund the transaction with the same distribution \nA full refund with cash \nSplit the refund between cash and credit card. \nHowever, you  CANNOT  refund this transaction with Care Credit. \nReporting \nTransactions made with additional payment methods will populate the  Transaction List ,  Sales Summary , and  Payment Distribution  reports. These reports can be viewed from the Vagaro Pro app and the Web version. See the Sales Summary Report , Transaction List Report , and Distribution Report articles for more information. \n  From the Transaction List Report : \n  \n If you click the  Action  drop-down menu, then select Receipt , you can print or email a receipt for this transaction, which will display each additional payment method used. \n  \n You can drill through a transaction by clicking the blue  Payment Amount  button in the  Other  column. This will open the  Other Payment Method  pop-up window, where you can review the amount charged for each payment method used for the transaction, including your new payment methods. \n  \n  From the Sales Summary Report : \n  \n You can review information about all sales made during a specific timeframe; more specifically, now you can review sales made with additional payment methods. Under  Total Sale , click the blue  Payment Amount  button on any relevant column to review your sales data. Your additional payment method will now display as a column item. \n  From the Payment Distribution Report : \n  \n You can review data on how much revenue each  Charge Type  brings in. From this report, your new payment methods will display as their own row item. Click the  Payment Method Name  for all the purchases made with that  Other Payment Method . \n",

Clients can book these remote services from the Vagaro App, Vagaro.com, or social media. Choose between live-streaming one-on-one sessions and live-streaming classes for multiple attendees. \n Vagaro Live Stream is fully automated and allows you to work from anywhere with ease. Once clients have booked a live stream session, they will receive a confirmation containing a link to the live stream. Vagaro synchronizes with the scheduled class or service. If you change the date and time or cancel the live stream, Vagaro will automatically update the meeting and notify all the participants. \nPrerequisites \n \n See  Getting Started with Vagaro Live Stream - Web Version  for activating and configuring Vagaro Live Stream using Vagaro on the web. \nWhat's in this article? \nSetting Up a Service with Live Streaming \nSetting Up a Class or Workshop with Live Streaming \nStart Live Stream for a Service, Class, or Workshop \nManaging Live Stream During Sessions \nSaving Session Recordings \nLive Stream Search \nTrack Registrants and Attendees \nHow do I use this? \nSetting up a Service with Live Streaming \nNavigate to Settings → Service/Class Menu . \nEdit an existing service or add a new service and then edit it. \n \n Note \n To learn more about adding services, see Add a Service - Web Version . \nTo enable the streaming capability, turn on the  Live Stream  toggle. \nWhen done editing the service, click Save . \n The service will now be offered as a live stream. \nNote \n Editing a service to add live streaming will only apply to future bookings. \nSetting up a Class or Workshop with Live Streaming \nClick Calendar , click in an empty time slot, and select New Class . \n  \n To edit a scheduled class, click the class and select Edit . \nTo add Live Streaming, enter the number of people who can participate in the  Live Stream Capacity  field, which activates the live stream option for this class. \nNote \n To make a class  In-House  or  Live Stream  ONLY, set a capacity for just that type. The \"0\" capacity type will be unavailable for booking. \nTo add attendees to a live-streamed class, click the class from the Calendar, hover over Add Attendees , select Live Stream, and add customer names from the list. \nNote \n When you look at a class on your calendar, you can see the number of attendees by hovering over the circles to see the number of in-house or live stream attendees. \nStart Live Stream for a Service, Class, or Workshop \nClick Calendar and then click the appointment you're going to begin live streaming. \n The video camera icon indicates classes and services are live-streamed. \nGo to  Change Status  and select Start Service (Live Stream Video) or Start Class (Live Stream Video) . \nVagaro Live Stream opens in a new tab. \n You can live stream from a computer or a mobile device. \nThe default speaker, microphone, and camera selections are shown on the session start-up screen. \n  \n Icons to toggle your camera and microphone are under the video preview. \n You can also change the defaults for  Start Recording  and the  Allow… for All  switches to set what participants can do when the session starts. \nWhen you're ready, click Start Appointment (or Class.) \nManaging Live Stream During a Session \nWhile live streaming, you can change the default settings that affect just the current session. \n Icons across the bottom of your screen give you options to: \nStart or stop the recording (the icon is red when recording). \nTurn off your camera. \nTurn off your microphone. \nChat with participants ( all  participants, there is no way to chat with just one out of a group). \nView or hide the Attendee Panel. \nView or hide the Settings Panel. \nEnd the appointment or class. \nSet your View \nThe host can choose from two views in a session:  Expanded  and  Gallery . \nThe  Expanded  view puts the host's video largest on the page, with smaller views of attendees across the bottom. \nIn  Gallery View , the host video is to the left on the screen, and attendee videos are arranged on the right. The size of the attendee video boxes depends on the total number of attendees. \nThe maximum number of attendees that can be displayed in either view is 20. After that, the host will see a box indicating how many more are in the class that can't be seen. \n There is a  More  (3 horizontal dots) menu for each attendee, which opens to show these options: \nPin  – pin any video stream to make it central/largest. \n Click the pin icon on the attendee's stream to unpin. \nMute  – turn off this attendee's microphone. \n  Note : you cannot unmute the attendee's mic; you'll have to ask them to unmute themselves. \nDisable Video  – turn off this attendee's camera. \nDisable Chat  – disable chat for this attendee. \n[attendee's full name]  – click the name to pop up the attendee's Vagaro Profile. \nChat Panel \nUsing chat, you can send messages to the group and let them communicate back.

There's also a pop-up for inserting emojis. \nAttendee Panel \nThe  Attendees  panel also has the same  More  menu options and shows you the attendee's full name and screen name for the session. Two sections let you see who is in the class and who signed up but is not there. \n  \n The  Attendee  panel has a button to  Disable  or  Enable  all microphones. This button works like the pre-session and  Settings Panel  toggle to  Allow Microphone , disabling individual microphone control. \nSettings Panel \nThe settings panel gives you control of settings for the duration of your session. \nSpeaker selection and volume control \nMicrophone selection and mic response indicator \nCamera selection \nAttendees (these settings affect all attendees): \nAllow Microphone \nAllow Camera \nAllow Chat \nSession Running Long? \nYou'll see a pop-up banner warning you when your scheduled session has five minutes left. This banner offers the option to extend the session an additional 10 minutes. Another warning banner displays when 60 seconds remain in the session. You can also extend it for 10 minutes from this banner. You can extend sessions by 10 minutes as many times as you need. \n  \n The session progress bar shows how long the session is scheduled to last, the progress toward that end time, and the time remaining in the session. \n When you extend the session, the  Remaining  indicator is red and shows how long over the scheduled time you are running. \n  \n When there are 60 seconds left in the scheduled session time, the host sees another pop-up screen. This screen also offers a 10-minute extension, or you can end the session immediately or wait until the session time expires (a countdown displays.) \n  \n If you click End Live Stream , you'll get another warning: \n  \n Click End Appointment if you're sure. \n The session ends for all attendees, who will see the  Leave Feedback  screen. The host can save the recording from here, leave feedback for the session, or close their Live Stream tab. \nSaving Session Recordings \nThe host can save the session recording to  Vagaro Drive  when the session is over. \n  \n If you don't have  Vagaro Drive  activated, you can't save recordings, and a screen will offer you options to activate  Vagaro Drive  and save the recording. \n  \n Click a storage plan to sign up. \n If you have  Vagaro Drive , but there's not enough space left to save your recording, you can add storage and save the file. \n  \n After saving the recording, you'll see a Feedback screen: \nNote \n It can take up to an hour to save a recording to Vagaro Drive, but you can leave the streaming tab now. \n \n After you send feedback or dismiss, close the Live Stream tab to release all audio and video resources. \n Vagaro Drive keeps saved videos in the Customers/ Appointment Files  or Customers/ Class Files  sections. \nYou'll see the red camera icon if the recording upload is complete. Otherwise, a pending icon displays, and instead of a date, the screen shows  Uploading…  \nClick the  Action  (3 horizontal dots) menu for options: \nOpen  - Since recordings cannot be viewed on Vagaro Drive, this opens the file's information panel with a download button. \nRename  the recording. \nDownload  a copy of the recording. \nInfo  - the same information panel that shows with the  Open  option. \nEdit Description  - you can also rename the recording here, too. \nDelete  the recording. \nLive Stream Search \nOnce you have set up your live stream services and classes, it's time to get booked! Vagaro offers a live stream search so clients worldwide can see live and upcoming virtual classes from businesses across the United States. \n  \n For your live stream class to show in the search, you must have an active  Vagaro Merchant Services  account. Being featured in the live stream search is free during the introductory period. Clients can filter all live streams by name/type, date, and duration or find live streams for their bookmarked businesses. \nTrack Registrants and Attendees \nOn the calendar screen, you can see the registered attendees in the class by selecting the  Edit  button. \nServices are listed on the calendar like all other appointments and display the video icon for those appointments that will be live-streamed. \n  \n If you edit the appointment, you'll see a video icon (red camera) in the  Appointment Note  area to indicate that they have previously recorded sessions. Click the icon to go to Vagaro Drive to download any recordings. \nThis feature works best with Vagaro Drive \n \n  You must have Vagaro Drive activated to store live stream session recordings.

There is no way to create a merchant account without this information. \n Even if you plan to use credit card processing as a business or organization, to create an account, you must provide your name, mailing address, date of birth, and a valid Social Insurance Number. If you are a company, partnership, or nonprofit, then you need the previously mentioned information and a Company Tax ID. \nWhat's Required to Complete the Application \n \n Regulatory requirements obligate us to verify and record information identifying each person who opens an account. \n The following information is  required  to activate your Vagaro merchant account: \nDoing Business As : Name shown on the customer's credit card statement \nLegal Business Name - Registered with City or State  \nBusiness Address  \nType of Business  \nBusiness Type  \nFull Legal Name  \nCanadian Home Address  \nPhone Number : \nEmail Address  \nSocial Insurance Number  and  Company Tax ID : Company Tax ID is not required if you are an individual or sole proprietor \nDate of birth : Current credit card regulations require our customers to be 18 years of age or older to create a merchant account \nState-Issued ID : Passport, driver's licence, permanent resident card, and identity card \nCanada-Based Banking Information  \nNeed Help?/More Information \nChoosing a Business Type \nPlease select the best industry type that fits your service/class offerings. You can change your industry type after your merchant account has been created. \nRegister Your Legal Business Name \nSee here to learn more : \n If you are a sole proprietor or individual doing business under your legal name, like Tom Smith, you usually are not required to register your business name. In some scenarios, you will need to register your name as your legal corporate or trade name. \n Merchants can change the  Doing Business As  (DBA) on their account, not the legal business name. If you want to change your legal business name on Vagaro, you will need to contact support ( support@vagaro.com ) with documentation supporting that change. \nWhat is a Company Tax ID (Business Number)? \nA Company Tax ID (or Business Number) is a unique identifier for a business or legal entity. \n For more information on when you need a Business Number, see here . \n  For the credit card processing application, only Sole Proprietorship business types do not require an Business Number.  \n See How to Register for a Business Number from the Canadian government website to learn how to apply for an Business Number. \nChoosing a Type of Business \nWhen signing up, you must classify how you’ll use our merchant services by selecting your  Business Type .

Your Vagaro page will look unique and will stand on its own without the Vagaro branding on top. It can act as a standalone page, not just as an extension of Vagaro, and will include all of the same tabs (Staff, Services, Gift Certificates, etc.). It's a great option for businesses that want to give themselves a boost or just a unique look. \nChoose one of our pre-made themes. These themes appear at the top of the website builder and come in different categories, including Hair, Beauty &amp; Spa, Nails, etc. \nUse the  Website Builder  to play with your own graphics and choose colors for the layout. Feel free to play with this; you won't be charged the monthly $10 until your next billing cycle. \nIf you do not see a pre-made template that you like or wish to have a designer help you create a design for you, you can contact Vagaro and speak with a designer. There is a one-time $100 fee for a custom design, and unlike the pre-made templates, your design will be specific to your own business and is one of a kind. \nFor more on creating your personalized Vagaro theme, see the following articles: \nUsing the Vagaro Theme Builder on the Vagaro Pro app \nUsing the Vagaro Theme Builder on the Web Version \nCan Vagaro Design a Personalized Theme for Me ? \n",

  "name": "Using the Cleanup Time Feature",
  "body": " \nAdd cleanup time at the end of services and classes for your instructors or service providers. The Cleanup Time feature lets you add time to appointment scheduling for employees to account for the time they'll spend cleaning up after the service/class before they can move on to their next appointment. \n From the customer's perspective, cleanup time does not affect the length of their appointment. The customer's booking and calendar (if they add the appointment to their personal calendar) show only the time the actual service or class takes. \n When customers book multiple services online, cleanup time is combined, and only the longest cleanup period is added to the booking. The business can manually change the default cleanup time while booking multiple services in-house. \nCleanup Time in Services and Classes \nConfigure or Edit Cleanup Time \nWhen you add or edit a service or class (recommended Vagaro or custom services/classes), you can set up the amount of time it will take a service provider to clean up after an appointment in preparation for the next appointment. To add or change cleanup time: \nWeb Version : Navigate to Settings → Service/Class Menu . \n  Vagaro Pro app : Start by tapping More , then Settings → Service/Class Menu \nSelect Services or Classes, choose an existing service or class, or create a new one. \n Click the Service or Class to edit. \nScroll down to the  Cleanup Time  switch (web) and toggle it on. \n For Vagaro Pro, there is no toggle; setting Cleanup time to anything greater than 0 enables it. \nWeb version: Services  \nVagaro Pro app: Services  \nWeb version: Classes  \nVagaro Pro app: Classes  \n Same as for Services. \nSet a period for cleanup time using the +/- signs to add or remove time in 5-minute increments. \nThe maximum time allowed is two hours (120 minutes). \nOn the web version, you can also type a number of minutes into the field. \n \n Note \n On the Vagaro Pro app, tap the duration for cleanup time and use the spinner to select the length of time. Tap Done to save the cleanup duration and then Save to finish the service or class entry. There is no toggle for Vagaro Pro; setting Cleanup Time to 0 minutes is the same as toggling it off in the web version. \nSave the entry. \nNote \n When customers book multiple services online, the time for the service with the longest cleanup time is used for all services once at the end, replacing the individual cleanup times for each service. \nCleanup Time on your Calendar \nThe business's calendar indicates the cleanup time with a darkened area in the appointment block. It also adds the   icon to indicate that there is added time for the appointment or class. \n When you hover over an appointment with added cleanup time, it will be noted in the pop-up display. \nNote \n The customer's calendar and appointments do not display information about cleanup time. \nEdit Cleanup Time from the Calendar \nYou can change the default cleanup time for a booked appointment. Any such change affects only that appointment, not the cleanup time setting of the service/class. \nClick an appointment with cleanup time on your calendar, then click Edit . On the appointment detail screen, you'll see the cleanup time with the  Duration  field. \nWeb  \nVagaro Pro app  \nClick the  Duration  field to edit various duration entries, including cleanup time. \nWeb  \nVagaro Pro app  \nClick Apply when you're done with the  Duration  entry, and click Save to save changes to the appointment. \nCleanup Time in Service Bundles \n \n When you create a service bundle, you configure cleanup time for each service in the bundle, whether the individual services have their own cleanup time entries. \n We're showing the steps in the Web version, but be aware that, like individual services and classes, there are differences in the Vagaro Pro version. \n For more on adding Service Bundles, see Add a Service Bundle - Vagaro Pro app or Add a Service Bundle - Web Version . \nService Bundles - Configure or Edit Cleanup Time \nWeb Version : Navigate to Settings → Service/Class Menu . \nClick an existing service bundle, or create a new one. \nScroll down to the Services included in the bundle. \nEnter a cleanup time for each service in the bundle. \n The maximum time allowed is two hours (120 minutes). \nSave the entry. \nService Bundles Cleanup Time on the Calendar \nThe business's calendar indicates the cleanup time with a darkened area in the appointment block. It also adds the   icon to indicate that there is added time for the appointment. \n Each service in a bundle has its own block on the calendar. \n  \n When you hover over an appointment with added cleanup time, it will be noted in the pop-up display. \nNote \n The customer's calendar and appointments do not display information about cleanup time. \nService Bundles - Edit Cleanup Time from the Calendar \nYou can change the default cleanup time for a booked service bundle. Any such change affects only that appointment, not the cleanup time setting for the bundle. \nClick an appointment for any part of a service bundle with cleanup time on your calendar, then click Edit . On the appointment detail screen, you'll see the cleanup time with the  Duration  field. \nClick the  Duration  field to edit the duration and cleanup time entries. (If the service has a gap processing time configured, this will also be editable under Service Duration. \nCleanup Time only  \nWith Gap Processing time  \nClick Apply when you're done with the  Duration  entry. \nRepeat for other services in the bundle, if needed. \nClick  Save  to save changes to the appointment. \nCleanup Time in the Booking Percentage Report \nThe  Booking Percentage  report ( Reports → Appointments → Booking Percentage , and on the  Dashboard ) now includes the  Cleanup Time  in the totals for the  Time Booked  field. This report can be viewed from both the Vagaro Pro app and Web versions. See this article . \n",

  "body": " \n Save money by switching to Vagaro's Live Stream option from Zoom integration.  Vagaro Live Stream  costs $10/month and can be used by all of your employees without additional licenses. If you need to stream multiple class or service sessions simultaneously, you'll need additional Vagaro Live Stream licenses but do not need to tie a license to an employee. \n \n Important \n At a future date, Vagaro will no longer support Zoom integration. \nHow do I use this? \nNavigate to Settings → Add-Ons and click Live Stream . \n On the Vagaro Pro app: More → Settings → Add-Ons → Live Stream . \nOn the Vagaro Live Stream page, click Activate – Starting at $10/mo . \n  \n A pop-up screen will warn that you will deactivate Zoom by activating Vagaro Live Stream. \nNote \n If you go first to the Zoom integration page ( Settings  &gt;  Add-Ons  &gt;  Integrations ), there will be a link to  Switch to Vagaro Live Stream , which will also deactivate your Zoom integration. \n (Vagaro Pro app:  More  &gt;  Settings  &gt;  Add-Ons  &gt;  Zoom Integration .) \nImportant \n Remember that you still must cancel your Zoom account! Deactivating the integration does not close your Zoom account, and you will still be charged by Zoom, even if you've deactivated the Vagaro integration. See Zoom support for information on closing your account with them. \nImportant \n The VLS conversion will convert your licenses, so it must be able to know how many Zoom licenses you have. It will also convert links to future streaming sessions to Vagaro Live Stream links, but it must be able to view the future planned Zoom sessions in order to do that. Do not disable your Zoom account or disable the Zoom integration before making the switch to Vagaro Live Stream. \nWhen you switch to Vagaro Live Stream from Zoom Integration, Vagaro sees the number of Zoom licenses you have, converts that to the same number of licenses for Live Stream, and allows you to change the number. \nIf you do not have Vagaro Drive activated for your account and want to save recordings of your Live Stream sessions, select a storage plan, and activate Vagaro Drive. \n  \n The storage plans section gives you an idea of how many hour-long sessions you can save with each drive size. \nVagaro will have changed links to future streams in the background when the integration switch is completed, so your customers do not have to be notified of or remember different links to get to their booked sessions. \n \n Important \n Your Live Stream customers must log in to their  Vagaro account  to use the new service. This sign-on requirement differs from Zoom integration, so please be aware and let your customers know. \nAdditional Information \nThis feature works best with Vagaro Drive \n \n You must have Vagaro Drive activated to store live stream session recordings. You can activate Vagaro Drive from the Live Stream activation page: https://vagaro.com/merchants/livestream \nRelated Articles \nGetting Started with Vagaro Live Stream - Vagaro Pro app \nGetting Started with Vagaro Live Stream - Web Version \nUsing Vagaro Live Stream - Vagaro Pro app \nUsing Vagaro Live Stream - Web Version \nVagaro Live Stream - for Customers of a Vagaro Business \n",

  "body": " \n Vagaro's Email and Text Marketing options include four pre-configured campaigns and one general ( Campaign Blast ) type that you can use to create a custom campaign. \n  Related articles : \nCreating Email &amp; Text Marketing Campaigns - Web Version \nCreating Email &amp; Text Marketing Campaigns - Vagaro Pro app \nWe used the  Campaign Blast  type in the main article about  Creating Email &amp; Text Campaigns . Now we'll talk about the four other campaign types you can use: \nBirthday \nLost Customer \nBefore Visit \nAfter Visit \nEach of these campaign types can be automated to send, for example, birthday greetings and offers to your customers without you needing to set up a campaign each time. You can send reminders to customers before they visit your business and a \"thank you\" after their visit, all automatically. Target customers who've not visited your business for a while and reach out to bring them back using a  Lost Customer  campaign. \n The steps for creating each type of campaign are the same, so we'll show you where things are slightly different for each type. \nCreate a new campaign. \nSelect a delivery method (email, text, or both). \nGive your campaign a title/email subject. \nClick the campaign type. \nFor  Birthday , use the slider to select how far in advance of the customer's birthday to send the campaign message. \n You can set this from 1 to 29 days before the birthday. \nFor  Lost Customer,  use the slider to select how long after a customer's last visit to send the campaign message (from 1 to 24 weeks). \nThe  Before Visit  campaign shows a slider you can use to select how many days (1-30) before the visit to send the campaign message. \nThe  After Visit  campaign shows a slider to select how many days (1-30) after the visit to send the campaign message. \nFollow the steps to finish setting up your campaign in Create Email &amp; Text Campaigns . \n",

  "body": " \nOnline and In-House Booking \n \n Set a price you want a customer to pay when booking services and classes with your business online or booking an appointment or class in-house. Set a minimum purchase amount, allowing you to set a threshold for when a customer must pay a deposit and control the types of clients who prepay online with the  deposit feature . \n Requiring a  deposit  is a great way to protect yourself from significant revenue losses due to no-shows or cancellations. \n Alternatively, by requiring  credit card capture , you can configure a cancellation/no-show fee as a percentage of the service or class cost, with selected thresholds and customer types. This allows you to save the customer's credit card on file and charge a fee if they do not show up to the scheduled appointment or are late to cancel their appointment. \nWe'll cover these features in the following sections: \nConfigure Deposits \nConfigure Credit Card Capture with Cancellation and No-Show Fees \nCollect Deposits \nCharge Cancellation/No-Show Fees \nHow Cancellation/No-Show Fees Affect Payroll \nRelated Article : Transaction List - View Deposits, No-Show, and Cancellation Fees \n \n Note \n Because the detail for the  Web  and  Vagaro Pro  versions are practically identical, we will use demo screens from the  Web  version and only note differences between the two. \nConfigure Deposits \nWhen you configure deposits for services or classes, you can collect all or a portion of the service or class cost.

Because of this, a tip field will show to add any tip. If a membership containing a discount is applied, the service price is discounted appropriately, and the business can choose another payment method to cover the remaining balance. \nUse Gift Certificate \nSend Invoice \n This option opens an invoice screen with the deposit information filled in. \nCredit card (shows type and last four digits of card on file) \nAdd New Credit Card \n Enter new card details and choose whether to save the new card to the customer's account. \nUse Different Payment Methods at Checkout Screen \n This option takes you to the Checkout page, where you can use more complex payment options such as points or splitting payments. \nFor Deposits : If a deposit covers the total cost of the service or class, the  Tip  field will be available to add a prepaid tip at the time of booking. \nCollect Deposits \n \n Whether a customer books for themselves online or you book an appointment or class for them in-house from the calendar, you can collect a deposit based on the configured deposit requirements in the Online Shopping Cart with  Deposits  turned on. \n If you do not have the Online Shopping Cart or choose to leave the Require Deposit options for services turned off, you can still collect deposits. \nCollect a Deposit When Booking a Service In-House \nCreate an appointment in your calendar. \nSelect a  Service . \nSelect a  Customer . \n Depending on how your deposit collection is configured, here is how the  Deposit Due  field will appear: \nCondition  \nDeposit Due field shows  \nOnline Shopping Cart - OFF \n$0 \nRequire Deposit - OFF \n$0 \nRequire Deposit - Deposits \nUse Same Rules for In-House Deposits - OFF \n$0 \nUse Same Rules for In-House Deposits - OFF \n$0 \nNote \n  Deposit Due  is populated after the system checks the configured policy (deposit amount or percentage, deposit threshold, rules for In-House deposits, new or old customers, house call service, number of no-shows, or cancellations.) \nSelect Deposit Due , select a deposit amount from the list or type in the amount you want to charge. \nWeb:  Click the  Deposit Due  field to edit or select a new deposit amount from the list. \nVagaro Pro : Tap the Deposit Due field to edit the amount shown or tap the right arrow ( &gt;

  "name": "Options for Product Management - Vagaro Pro app",
  "body": " \n This article covers several product detail options that control how you use and sell some products in Vagaro. \n  \n  Vagaro gives you options for managing your product inventory, whether you're selling products to customers at your store, online, or keeping track of products used in-house for services. You can track your product inventory, designate products that will only be sold in product bundles or used for packaginging (gift packaging and shipping materials.) Designate products that you'll sell through your Online Shopping Card (if activated) and set up shipping options and costs. \nPrerequisites \n \n  Available for all Vagaro businesses.  \nNavigation \n \n The options we'll be covering are: \nDrop-ship (next section) \nDo Not Track \nFor Business Use Only \nFor Bundle Use Only \nPackaging Product \nSell Product Online \nAll these options are on the Product edit screen: More → Settings → Things We Sell → Inventory . Either use Add (at the top of the inventory screen) or edit an existing product: Select a product, tap the  Action  menu (3 horizontal lines) and tap Edit . \nDrop Ship Product \n \n If you sell a product that you don't want to or cannot stock in your business, you can set the  Drop Ship  switch to send an email to the product vendor instructing them to ship directly to the buyer. \n When you set Drop Ship Product on, you'll see that the  Do Not Track  switch is also activated, and the system hides the fields for Quantity, Low Quantity Warning, and Max Quantity. \nDrop Ship Product off (Do Not Track set to off)  \nDrop Ship Product on (Do Not Track set to on)  \nCurrently,  Drop Ship Product  is only for use with products sold online, so remember to set  Sell Product Online  to  On . \n \n Tip \n Check that the email you have on file for the drop ship vendor ( Settings → Things we Sell → Vendors ) is the one to use for emailing these orders. \nTip \n Please coordinate with your drop ship product's vendor before setting up Drop Ship for your online store. You should get information such as product dimensions and weight and what shipping options to offer from your vendor to configure the  Sell Online  options for drop ship products. \nDo Not Track \n \n Businesses can now sell products that are not tied to inventory. Examples of products you could set as \"Do Not Track\" are non-physical products, which would include fees (like Aroma Therapy and PPE fees) and items used in services but not tracked for inventory.  Do Not Track  is also used with  Drop Ship Product  because you do not have to track the inventory of items shipped to your customer from the vendor. \n To set  Do Not Track : From the product detail screen, in  Track Product Inventory , select Do Not Track . The fields for Quantity, Low Quantity Warning, and Max Quantity are not shown when  Do Not Track  is on. \nDo Not Track switch off  \nDo Not Track switch on  \n  \n Note that the Quantity fields are hidden. \nFor Business Use Only \n \n Set this switch if you have products you do not want to make available to customers. Setting it on removes the switch for  Sell Product Online . \nFor Bundle Use Only \n \n Use for products that are only sold as part of a Bundle. See Creating Product Bundles for details. Setting it on removes the switch for  Sell Product Online . \nPackaging Product \n \n When you have products you use for packaging: gift boxes, shipping boxes, or other shipping supplies that are not sold to customers alone or as part of a bundle, set this switch  On . Setting it on removes the switch for  Sell Product Online . \nSell Product Online \n \n Set On for products that can be sold through your Vagaro Online Store. To use this, you must have set up your  Vagaro Shopping Cart . (See Add the Online Shopping Cart - Vagaro Pro app .) \n  \n When you turn  Sell Product Online  on, you must enter shipping-related information about the product. \nDimensions (length, width, and height in inches) \nWeight in pounds \nFree Ground Shipping : Set on to allow free product shipping. The Shipping and handling surcharges will automatically display a $0 cost. If you do not want to offer free ground shipping, enter a shipping and handling cost. \nTo set a flat rate shipping price, select Flat Rate Shipping . Then enter a price for  1st Item Shipping Price  and  Additional Item Shipping Price  (if used). For more about flat rate shipping, see Set Shipping Options for Online Product Sales . \nNext Steps and Recommended Features \nThis Feature Works Best With... \nWith Credit Card Processing activated, your customers can buy products through your online booking page. \n Vagaro offers competitive credit card processing rates and a wide range of other benefits, including selling services, products, memberships, and gift certificates online.

This is also a great option if you are new to Vagaro to ensure a smooth transition for you and your clients. \nIf you do not have Credit Card Processing and try to drag in this module, you will receive this pop up. The pop up contains a button allowing you to sign up for a Merchant Services account. \nNote \n The Payment or Contact Module cannot be used in mandatory forms. This is to prevent your customers from being asked to enter their credit card or personal info multiple times during booking if you already require a card to be placed on file. You can utilize our Online Shopping Cart to require credit card capture at the time of booking. You can learn more about the Online Shopping Cart here . \nOnce you have created your form, you can include the link in an email or text marketing campaign ( Vagaro Pro / Web Version ), or you embed your form on your business website.

  "url": "https://support.vagaro.com/hc/en-us/articles/360034898234-HIPAA-Compliance",
  "name": "HIPAA Compliance",
  "body": " \n To support Vagaro businesses that are in the healthcare and wellness industries, we have redesigned our privacy rules to make sure that we comply with the requirements of the HIPAA Privacy Rules. \n Vagaro has worked with a third party, the Compliancy Group, to ensure this. To view our seal of HIPAA Compliance, click here . Once you get to this page, scroll down to the bottom of the screen to see it. \n Click here to learn how to send HIPAA-compliant text messages, push notifications, and emails to clients in Vagaro. \n  In this article, we will go over:  \nThe definition of HIPAA (follows) \nThe HIPAA Privacy &amp; Security Rules \nThe types of businesses that must follow HIPPA \nThe type of information that is protected \nHow the Information is Protected \nRecommendations to stay HIPAA Compliant \nWhat is HIPAA? \n \n HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) was established to protect patient health information and control its use. \n The main goal is to ensure that patient information is properly protected while allowing the flow of health information needed to provide and promote high-quality health care and protect a client's health and well-being. \n Since the healthcare industry is so diverse, HIPAA is designed to be flexible and comprehensive to cover the different ways information is used while protecting the privacy of people who seek care and healing. \nThe HIPAA Privacy and Security Rule \n \n HIPAA rules consist of national standards to protect patient medical records and other personal health information. It also: \nGives patients more control over their health information. \nSets boundaries on the use and release of health records. \nEstablishes appropriate measures that health care professionals and others must achieve to protect the privacy of medical information. \nKeeps violators accountable by imposing civil and criminal penalties for violating patient privacy rights. \nFor patients, it means being able to make informed decisions when seeking care based on how personal health information is used. It specifically: \nAllows patients to find out how their information is used. \nGenerally restricts the release of information to the minimum needed for the purpose of the disclosure. \nGenerally gives customers the right to examine and get a copy of their health records and request corrections. \nPermits individuals to control certain uses and disclosures of their health information. \nWho Must Follow HIPAA \n \n The following entities are considered covered entities and must follow HIPAA: \nHealth Plans  including health insurance companies, HMOs, company health plans, and certain government programs that pay for health care, such as Medicare and Medicaid. \nMost Health Care Providers  - especially those that conduct certain business electronically, such as electronic health insurance billing. This includes most doctors, clinics, hospitals, psychologists, chiropractors, nursing homes, pharmacies, and dentists. \nHealth Care Clearinghouses  - businesses that process nonstandard health information they receive from another entity or vice versa. \nBusiness Associates  by virtue of their relationship with covered entities. \nWhat Type of Information is Protected? \nClient medical records that are inputted by doctors, nurses, and other healthcare providers. \nPatient conversations with doctors about care or treatment with nurses and others. \nClient information that's entered into a health insurer’s computer system. \nBilling information about the client and clinic. \nOther client health information held by professionals who are required to follow HIPAA laws. \nHow is the Information Protected? \nHealthcare businesses must have the proper measures in place to protect health information and ensure that it is not used or disclosed improperly. \nFacilities must have procedures in place to restrict who can view and access client health information and implement training programs for employees on how to protect medical information. \nEntities must have the appropriate safeguards to protect health information and ensure they do not use or improperly release this data. \nRecommendations to Stay HIPAA Compliant \n \n Here's a list of recommendations by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to help you stay HIPAA compliant. \n  1 - Establish clinic-wide privacy measures.  \n Appoint a privacy officer and contact person to oversee privacy issues. This individual is the point person for receiving complaints and training all employees on privacy matters, specifically letting staff know about PHI (protected health information) disclosure restrictions and practices. \n  2 - Get consent to collect, use, and release PHI.  \n The keys to proper consent for collecting, using, and disclosing health information under HIPAA are: \nCreating a set of policies and procedures, and \nDocumenting those policies and measures along with any cases of use or disclosure. \n3 - Develop an emergency plan.  \n Be sure to create a plan that you can use if an emergency threatens the security and privacy of PHI. Make sure that the right staff members have access to PHI in case of various emergencies. In certain cases, consider restoring data from one location to another. \n  4 - Come up with processes that give patients easy access to their records.  \n Under HIPAA, the Privacy Rule requires clinics and healthcare professionals to turn over copies of health records within 30 days of receiving a written request. Clients also have the right to have their health records corrected in a timely fashion. \n  5 - Make sure your devices, website, and network are secure  \n Build and maintain a secure website that is in line with all HIPAA privacy requirements for identifying information. Run the site on a secure network with all the proper safeguards and get professional help if you need to. Here are some additional safety precautions to take: \nRequire a secure password-protected login. \nPut timeouts on your devices so that they automatically log out if you're not actively using them. \nTrain staff to act with integrity when handling electronic health information, including not destroying or changing records. \nRequire authentication for all staff or entities who access PHI. \nMake sure that data transfers that include PHI are encrypted. \n6 - Think about your PHI storage options  \n Weigh your options regarding storing your clinic’s health information, whether you decide to store it as a hard copy, on your own servers, or in a cloud-based practice management system. \n Think about a solution that meets the needs of your daily workflow while also adhering to HIPAA. Also, consider choosing a combination of these storage options. \n  7 - Sign a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) with software vendors.  \n HIPAA requires a written contract between clinics and any other entity handling health information. For this contract, HIPAA defines two types of organizations: \nCovered Entity : This is the organization that records the data. This mainly pertains to health clinics and practitioners or anyone treating patients or seeing clients. \nBusiness Associate : The organization helps store and process data on behalf of the covered entity. \n8 - Become familiar with your state laws.  \n Check state laws that have additional privacy requirements beyond HIPAA. Here are some specific things to consider: \nWhere state law is less strict than HIPAA, HIPAA will apply. \nWhere state law is stricter than HIPAA, state law will apply. \nIn many cases, more stringent state laws involve reporting public health information, such as communicable diseases or child abuse, or birth and death records. \n9 - Stay current on Privacy Laws  \n Remember, laws often change. Ensure that your privacy officer stays informed of any changes to privacy requirements and has a strategy to keep your practice up to date on the latest changes. Also, be sure to update your policies periodically as needed. \n To learn more about HIPAA, click here . \n",

  "body": " \n What's in this Article? \nRun your Payroll Report (next) \nRunning Payroll for Multiple Locations \nUnderstanding the Payroll Report \nHow to Close Out Payroll \nAdditional Information \nPrerequisites \n \n  This feature is available for all Vagaro businesses  \n However, Gusto integration is recommended if you want to send your employees direct deposits. See This Feature Works Best With Gusto for more information. \nRun your Payroll Report \nThings to keep in mind while reading this article \nPlease set up your  Payroll Configuration  before running Payroll. Nothing will display if you do not have payroll configured for your employees. \nThe  Payroll  report is a live report and will recalculate hourly rates, commissions, and frequency based on your  Payroll Configuration  . \nVagaro's payroll system is great for payroll reporting, and with Vagaro's Gusto integration, you can set up direct deposits and income tax withholding for your employees. \nThe steps for closing payroll with Gusto are slightly different than those displayed below. See here to learn more. \nVagaro Pro App \nGo to  More → Reports → Payroll . \nTap the  icon in the top-right corner, select the  Payroll Closing Date  using the   icons, and then select the  Service Provider(s)  you want to review. \n  \n If you do not select a  Service Provider , all employees will be displayed. \n \n Note \n Expand advanced filters to  Include Past Employees  and run payroll for multiple locations. \n See here to learn more about multi-location payroll. \nTap the  Sort By  field to sort the report by  Business Costs ,  Hourly Pay ,  Commission , and more. \nTap Run Report . \nTap the   icon in the top-right corner to  Print  the report or export to  Excel  or  PDF . \nWeb Version \nGo to  Reports → Payroll . \nSelect the  Payroll Closing Date  using the   icons, then select the  Service Provider(s)  you want to review. \n  \n If you do not select a  Service Provider , all employees will be displayed. \n \n Note \n Expand advanced filters to  Include Past Employees  and run payroll for multiple locations. \n See here to learn more about multi-location payroll. \nClick Run Report . \nIn the bottom-right corner, click Export to export the  Payroll Report  to Excel or a PDF file. Click Print to get a paper copy. \nRunning Payroll for Multiple Locations \n \n You can run payroll for multiple locations at once. If an employee works at more than one location, both businesses will display in the  Business Name  column. \n Instead of running reports and paying employees in batches, you can calculate how much an employee is owed within one report. \n \n Important \n You can't run payroll for multiple locations if your  Payroll Frequency ,  Payroll Closing Day , and  Gusto Company ID  do not match all businesses selected. If the configuration for all selected businesses doesn't match, a pop-up will display what doesn't match. \n For Gusto integration, the  Gusto Company ID  must match to run payroll for multiple businesses at once. \nVagaro Pro App \nFrom the  Payroll  report, tap the   icon. \nTap the  Business Location  field. \nSelect the locations you want to review, then tap Apply . \nSelect the  Payroll Closing Date  with the   icons, then select the  Service Provider(s)  you want to review. \nTap Run Report . \nWeb Version \nFrom the  Payroll  report, expand Advanced Filters . \nExpand the  Business Location  drop-down menu and select the locations you want to review. \nSelect the  Payroll Closing Date  with the   icons, then select the  Service Provider(s)  you want to review. \nClick Run Report . \nUnderstanding the Payroll Report \nWith the Vagaro Pro App \nWhen you run the Payroll report on your mobile device, you'll find that each employee's payroll information is organized into cards. These cards contain details such as the employee's hourly rate, hours worked, business cost, gross sales, and commission. The  Payroll Due  row, located at the bottom of the card, shows the total amount owed to the employee.  The Payroll Due total does not include income tax deductions . \n  \n If a card contains the   icon, you can drill through the report to access individual transactions. Each transaction will be displayed as a separate card. For instance, you could drill through an employee's payroll report to review the transactions where they earned commission for specific services. This data is sourced from your  Transaction List  report. \n  \n  You can also drill through an employee's Hourly Rate if they worked multiple roles. See Role-Based Hourly Pay for more information. \nWith the Web Version of Vagaro \nThe  Payroll  report generates a table with your employees' payroll information, which is organized into separate rows for each employee. Each row contains details such as the employee's hourly rate, hours worked, gross sales, and commission earned. The final column,  Payroll Due , displays the amount you owe each employee.  The Payroll Due total does not include income tax deductions . \n  \n  If a field is clickable, you can drill through the report to access individual transactions. This allows you to review specific transactions, such as commissions earned by an employee for certain services. This data is sourced from your  Transaction List  report. \n  \n Additionally, if an employee worked multiple roles, you can drill through their hourly rate to view the role-based pay information. See Role-Based Hourly Pay for more information. \nHow to Close Out Payroll \n \n It's important to keep in mind that when closing out payroll, you won't be able to do so for individual employees. In order to properly close out payroll, you must ensure that all employees are selected. Click or tap  Payroll Paid  to close out payroll for all employees. Once  Payroll  has been finalized, you can view the saved report in  Payroll History  . \n For a more detailed explanation of how to close out payroll with Vagaro and Gusto, see here . \nAdditional Information \nThis Feature Works Best With Gusto \nEliminate your bookkeeping and payroll issues and spend less time on money management, time card calculations, and processing employee pay with Vagaro's integration with  Gusto ! \n  You can also do the following with this powerful feature: \nGet real-time payroll reports \nCentralize and track payments, invoices, employee hours, and payroll \nBoost productivity by freeing up valuable time \nAutomate key administrative functions in bookkeeping and payroll \nAvoid costly manual errors with automation \nSeamlessly sync hours and earnings \nEase the employee onboarding process with Gusto's streamlined onboarding platform \nTake advantage of flexible payroll options \nSync any type of pay structure \nAutomatically calculate and deduct tax withholding \nSee here to learn how to activate Gusto Integration. \n \n Note \n Gusto and Vagaro's integration is free but requires a Gusto subscription.

The  Net Deposit  is the true profit received after the credit card fees have been deducted from the transactions. \nBatch Times \n \n The deposits you receive in your merchant account will not always match your  Transaction List  because of the batch cut-off time. More specifically, transactions that occur before  3 PM Pacific Time  or  6 PM Eastern Time  are included in a single batch. It then takes about 24 hours to deposit to your bank account. One of the few exceptions is transactions that occur after 3 PM on Friday and those that happen on Saturday or Sunday. These take two days to deposit to your bank. This is due to banks being closed on Sundays. If a transaction occurs after the 3 PM cut-off time, it's included in the next day's batch. \n There is also a two-day deposit time for transactions before a holiday. \nThe Batch Schedule \nBatch Day  \nDeposit Day  \nMonday \nTuesday \nTuesday \nWednesday \nWednesday \nThursday \nThursday \nFriday \nFriday \nTuesday \nSaturday \nTuesday \nSunday \nTuesday \nMake Sure Your Routing and Bank Account Numbers are Correct \n \n If you're still not receiving deposits, make sure the routing and bank account numbers in your merchant account are correct.

Then click the link in the status column. \nAnalytics from Daily Deals \nOnce you click the  Announced  option for a  Daily Deal  you have two tabs to view:  Revenue  and  Email/Text .

See Create a New Membership . \nImportant \n When a renewing membership payment fails, Vagaro will attempt to retry the customer's card two times after the initial failure. \n  Sunday : Renewal fails. Membership status changes to \"inactive,\" and the customer can't use their membership visits. \n  Tuesday : Vagaro attempts to charge their card again. If the payment goes through successfully, the membership status changes to \"active.\" If the transaction fails on Tuesday, the membership will remain \"inactive.\" \n  Friday : Vagaro attempts to charge the card again.

  "body": " \n With Email and Text Marketing Campaigns, you can automatically message customers after their visit to ask them to fill out a \"customer satisfaction\" form, leave a review on your site or your social media, and more. \n We'll explain how to set up your after-visit campaign and add buttons and links that incentivize customers to write reviews. \n \n Remember! \n  After Visit  campaigns are automatic. Once set up, the campaign will be sent to any customer that meets the criteria. \nGet Started \nNavigate to Marketing → Email &amp; Text Marketing → Create Campaign . \nClick Create Campaign to get started. \nSelect Delivery Method. \nEmail \nText \nEmail &amp; Text \nEnter a  Title  for your campaign. \n This will also be used as the email subject line. \nYou can add emojis to the campaign title by clicking the emoji icon and selecting one or more. \n  \n Don't use too many emojis, so your message isn't marked as spam! \nSelect After Visit as the Campaign Type. \nUse the slider to choose the number of days following the visit to send the campaign, from 1 to 30 days. \nSelect Services and Classes to include in the campaign from the drop-down list. \n You can select entire categories or individual services and classes. \nSelect Recipients. \n  \n You can choose  All Customers  or  Filtered List.  The Specific Customers option is not available for this campaign type. \nIf you want a filtered list, set the filter criteria, and click Apply . \n  \n You can edit the filter criteria or change the campaign to All Customers later. \nSelect a time of day for your campaign to be sent by clicking the clock icon and selecting the time. \nClick Next to continue configuring your campaign. \nDesign Your Email Campaign \n \n Set up your campaign's look and messaging on the next screen. You can use one of the existing Templates or the Design Tab to create your unique email message. We'll use a template for our campaign. \nScroll through the list of email template categories, select one, and then click a design to use. \n  \n When you select a template, the system opens it in the Design tab. \n The templates have some preconfigured elements, but you can edit them as you like. \nDrag the  Button  module onto the design. \n  \n You can place it above or below the existing template elements. \nEdit each button. \n You can control the button color, size (height and width), radius (rounded corners), and text color. \nChoose the  Button Link  type from the drop-down list. We're using  Other . \nEdit the button text to tell the customer where the link will take them. \nProvide the URL for the review page you're sending them to. \n The button does not appear in the message if you don't enter a URL. \nClick Save to finish this module. \nIf you want to add more buttons, drag another button module onto the design. \n Each button module holds up to three buttons. \nPreview your email by clicking the web or mobile  Preview  tabs. You can also send an email preview to yourself or others. \nClick Next to continue. \nSet Up Your Text Campaign \n \n If you created a campaign with email and text, you can compose your message and add links for the text campaign on the next page. \nCompose Text  - Enter the message for the text. \n A preview of your message displays on the mobile device image as you enter it. \nClick Insert Link . \nYou can use the  Leave A Review  link type to provide a link to the review page on your booking site or use Other to provide a custom URL to a social media review site. \nClick Send Text Preview and provide mobile phone numbers for testing your text campaign message. Click Send to finish. \n Use commas to separate multiple text numbers. \nFinishing and Sending Your Campaign \n \n If you are ready to finalize the campaign to send, read and click the acknowledgment box to accept, and then click Announce . This puts your campaign in the sending queue and waits for the selected number of days and time of day to send to customers following their visit for selected services or classes. \n  \n You can click Save for Later to hold off on announcing the campaign. The campaign will be in  Draft  status on your Marketing Campaigns page, and you can edit and announce it when you're ready. \n  To send a saved draft campaign : \nOpen a draft campaign from the Marketing Campaigns page. \nClick Next on each page until you return to the final page with the Announce button. \nClick the Acknowledgment box and then click Announce . \n The campaign status changes to  Announced  and your campaign will be sent to customers as configured. \nEmail/Text Campaigns on Vagaro Pro \n \n All of the campaign creation processes we've shown above are done on the web version of Vagaro. \n While you can set up the same types of campaigns on the Vagaro Pro app, there are some limitations and differences: \nYou can only use the built-in templates \nYou cannot add modules, so you are limited to the three buttons built into the template \nThe  Schedule  option to set a send time for your campaign is near the end of the campaign setup process \n",

  "name": "Options for Product Management - Web version",
  "body": " \n This article covers several product detail options that control how you use and sell some products in Vagaro. \n  \n Vagaro gives you options for managing your product inventory, whether you're selling products to customers at your store, online, or keeping track of products used in-house for services. You can track your product inventory, designate products that will only be sold in product bundles or used for packaginging (gift packaging and shipping materials.) Designate products that you'll sell through your Online Shopping Card (if activated) and set up shipping options and costs. \nPrerequisites \n \n  Available for all Vagaro businesses.  \nNavigation \n \n The options we'll be covering are: \nDrop-ship (next section) \nDo Not Track \nFor Business Use Only \nFor Bundle Use Only \nPackaging Product \nSell Product Online \nAll these options are on the Product edit screen: Settings → Things We Sell → Inventory . Either use Edit → Add a Product (at the top of the inventory screen) or when you edit an existing product ( More → Edit at the end of each product entry row.) \nDrop Ship Product \nIf you sell a product you don't want to or cannot stock in your business, you can set the  Drop Ship  switch to send an email to the product vendor instructing them to ship directly to the buyer. \n When you set Drop Ship Product on, you'll see that the  Do Not Track  switch is also activated, and the system hides the fields for Quantity, Low Quantity Warning, and Max Quantity. \n  Drop Ship Product off (Do Not Track set to off)  \n  \n  Drop Ship Product on (Do Not Track set to on)  \n  \n Currently,  Drop Ship Product  is only for use with products that are sold online, so remember to set  Sell Product Online  to  On . \n \n Tip \n Check that the email you have on file for the drop ship vendor ( Settings → Things we Sell → Vendors ) is the one to use for emailing these orders. \nTip \n Please coordinate with your drop ship product's vendor before setting up Drop Ship for your online store. You should get information such as product dimensions and weight and what shipping options to offer from the vendor to set the  Sell Online  options for drop ship products. \nDo Not Track \nBusinesses can now sell products that are not tied to inventory. Examples of products you could set as \"Do Not Track\" are non-physical products, including fees (like Aroma Therapy and PPE fees) and items used in services but not tracked for inventory.  Do Not Track  is also used with  Drop Ship Product  because you do not have to track the inventory of items shipped to your customer from the vendor. \n To set  Do Not Track : From the product detail screen, in  Track Product Inventory , set the switch to  Do Not Track . Quantity, Low Quantity Warning, and Max Quantity fields are not shown when Do Not Track is on. \n  Do Not Track switch off  \n  \n  Do Not Track switch on (note Quantity fields hidden)  \nFor Business Use Only \n \n Set this switch if you have products you do not want to make available to customers. Setting it on removes the switch for  Sell Product Online . \nFor Bundle Use Only \n \n Use for products that are only sold as part of a Bundle. Setting it on removes the switch for  Sell Product Online . See Creating Product Bundles for details. \nPackaging Product \n \n When you have products you use for packaging: gift boxes, shipping boxes, or other shipping supplies that are not sold to customers alone or as part of a bundle, set this switch  On . Setting it on removes the switch for  Sell Product Online . \nSell Product Online \n \n Set On for products that can be sold through your Vagaro Online Store. To use this, you must have set up your  Vagaro Shopping Cart . (See Add the Online Shopping Cart .) \n  \n When you turn  Sell Product Online  on, you must enter shipping-related information about the product. \nDimensions (length, width, and height in inches) \nWeight in pounds \nFree Ground Shipping : Set on to allow free product shipping. The Shipping and handling surcharges will automatically display a $0 cost. If you do not want to offer free ground shipping, enter a shipping and handling cost. \nTo set a flat rate shipping price, select Flat Rate Shipping . Then enter a price for  1st Item Shipping Price  and  Additional Item Shipping Price  (if used). For more about flat rate shipping, see Setting Shipping Costs for Online Product Sales . \nNext Steps and Recommended Features \nThis Feature Works Best With... \nWith Credit Card Processing activated, your customers can buy products through your online booking page. \n Vagaro offers competitive credit card processing rates and a wide range of other benefits, including selling services, products, memberships, and gift certificates online.

Add an optional comment, then tap Clock Out . \nUsing the Employee Timecard to Clock In and Out \nEmployees can swipe their  Employee Timecard  with a  USB Credit Card Reader  or scan the barcode on the back of the card using the barcode scanner. \nAfter swiping or scanning, a message displays at the top of the Pay Desk screen to confirm that the clock in or out was successful. \n \n Note \n Employees can swipe or scan their Employee Timecard from any screen on the Pay Desk without interrupting an ongoing task such as checking out a client. \nIf your employee profile is assigned to multiple roles, a role selection window displays. Select your role, add an optional comment, then tap Clock In . \nWhen clocking out, you do not need to reselect the role. Add an optional comment, then tap Clock Out . \nLocate the Most Recent Time Stamp \nTap More and then the employee name. \n  \n The latest clock-in time displays below the QR code. \nNote \n If an employee forgets to clock in or out, you can manually edit their timecard . \n",

  "name": "Set Your Business Type on Vagaro",
  "body": " \n Your  Business Type  on Vagaro is determined by the services you offer. Our software is able to generate your business type based on services you include on your Service/Class Menu by recognizing key phrases in your service names. To properly categorize your business type, follow the guidelines below: \n If you want your business to show as a  hair salon,  then you will need to use key phrases such as  color, highlight, blowdry,  or  cut  in some of your service names. \n If your business shows up under an incorrect business type, then you will need to remove the key phrases for that business type from your service titles. For example, if your  salon  shows a business type of  cryotherapy , you would need to remove the phrases  cryo, freezing,  or  cryotherapy  from all your service names. \n The number of times you use the key phrases in your service names will also contribute to how your business type is determined. For example, if you have 10 services with key phrases for the hair salon business type and only one for the threading business type, \"hair salon\" will be dominant, so it will be shown as your business type. \n The list below shows you which key phrases will match each business type: \n \n Note \n These key phrases must be used as shown on the list below to work correctly. For example,  hot tub  will show as a  spa  business, but only using  hot  or only using  tub  will not. \nAcupuncture  \nacupuncture, moxibustion, electroacupuncture \nAuto Detailing  \nautomotive, car \nBarber  \nfade, taper, shave, razor, barber, edge up, under cut, beard trim, hot towel \nBody Enhancement  \nbody contouring, bbl, butt lift, lipo \nBraids  \ninterlacing, braid, cornrow, box braids \nBrow Bar  \nbrow, eyebrow \nChiropractor  \nchiropractic, spine, posture \nCryotherapy  \ncryo, cryotherapy, freezing \nCycling  \nspin, bike, cycle \nDance Studio  \ndancing, dance, ballet, zumba, hip hop, zouk, salsa, jazz, ballroom, tango, belly dancing, bollywood, bhangra, pole dancing, pole fitness, pole \nElectrolysis  \nelectrolysis \nEquestrian  \nhorse, horseback riding, horseback, equestrian, equine, dressage \nExtensions  \ntape ins, nbr, weave, sew in, hand tied, extensions, extension maintenance, box \nFitness Studio  \nfitness, workout, gym, fitness center, crossfit, cross fit, hiit \nGyrotonic  \ngyro, gyrotonic \nHair Replacement  \nreplacement, wig, transplant \nHair Salon  \nsalon, highlight, color, blowdry, blow dry, straightening, thermal press, foil, perm, bang trim, haircut, side burns, sideburns, balayage, fantasy color, blowout, keratin, relaxer, colour \nHolistic Therapy  \nholistic, cupping, aromatherapy, reiki, chakra, energy healing, crystal healing, sound bath, biofeedback, healing room, reading, toe reading, tarot \nJewelry  \njewelry \nLaser Hair Removal  \nlhr, laser hair, laser removal \nLash Bar  \neyelash extension, lash extension, eyelash tint, eyelash fill, eyelash lift, lash tint, lash fill, lash lift, lash set, lash, eyelash \nLife and Wellness Coaching  \nlifestyle coaching, life coach, wellness coach, relationship coach, sponsor, sobriety coach \nLocs  \nloc, dreadlock, interlocks \nMakeup  \nmakeup \nMartial Arts  \ntaekwondo, jiu-jitsu, karate, jeet kun do, krav maga, judo, aikido, self defense, mma, capoeira, kung fu, kendo, kick boxing, Tai Chi, Qigong \nMassage  \nmassage, swedish, shiatsu, soft tissue, deep tissue, lymphatic drainage, reflexology, hot stone, acupressure \nMedical Spa  \npreventative, pharmaceutical, procedure, botox, filler, injection, sclerotherapy, vein, iv, hormone, injection, juvederm, dysport, toradol, ketorolac, vampire facial, vaginal rejuvanation, scar, vericose, cool sculpting, ipl, oxygeneo, augmentation, surgical \nMicroblading  \nmicroblade, microblading \nNail Salon  \nmanicure, pedicure, shellac, gel, nail polish, toes, nails, color change nails, color change toes, acrylic \nNatural Hair  \nnatural hair \nNutritionist  \nnutrition, dietitian, eating, juicing \nPermanent Makeup  \npermanent, eyeliner, makeup \nPersonal Trainer  \npersonal training, fitness coaching \nPet Grooming  \ndog, puppy, pet, glands \nPhoto Studio  \npicture, portrait, photography, photographer \nPhysical Therapy  \npt, physical therapy, rehabilitation, physiotherapy,compression therapy \nPickleball  \npickleball \nPiercing  \npierce, piercing \nPilates  \npilates, contrology, reformer \nRock Climbing  \nclimbing, rock \nSkin Care  \nexfoliation, skin care, skin, facial, rejuvenation, cosmetic, microdermabrasion, peel, acne, pimple, zit \nSpa  \nsauna, whirlpool, hot tub, extended stay, relaxation, spa, scrub, salt room, float, light therapy, illuminate, radiate, radiation, infrared, relaxation therapy, soak, steam \nSports Training  \nbasketball, baseball, football, hockey, soccer, lacrosse, ice skating, field hockey, volleyball, gymnastics, cheerleading, track field, wrestling, fencing, boxing, golf, tennis, kickboxing \nSugaring  \nsugaring, sugar \nSwimming  \nswim, pool, aquatic, swimming \nTanning Salon  \ntan, tanning \nTattoos  \ntattoo, tattooing \nTattoo Removal  \ntattoo removal \nTeeth Whitening  \nteeth whitening, whitening \nTherapy  \nmarriage counseling, hypnosis, anxiety, depression, substance abuse, cognitive, mental health, behavioral, behavioural, psychotherapy \nThreading  \nthread, thread hair, threading \nUltrasound  \nfetus, ultrasound, peek \nWaxing  \nwax, waxing \nYoga  \nyoga, asana, meditative, bikram, vinyassa, yin, kundalini, ashtanga, iyengar, hatha \n",

  "body": " \n The Star TSP100iii W is one of the best receipt printers on the market, and it's super easy to use. This forum will teach how to install, connect, and troubleshoot the printer with your Android Device. \n For other devices, click the linked articles below: \n For IOS Mobile Devices \n For Mac Desktop/Laptop Computers \n For Windows Desktop/Laptop Computers \n  Article Content  \nPhysical Setup \nConnecting to Device through WPS \nConnecting to Device Manually \nTest Print \nPhysical Setup \nFirst, turn on the Main Unit Power. Connect the power cable to the inlet on the back of the TSP100iii W. Connect the plug of the power cable into the outlet. \nOn the left-hand side of the device, flip the switch on and check that the blue LED light is lit up. \nNext, you should insert a roll of paper. Check that the power is on. Push the lever on the top to open the cover. \nNote \n When using a paper roll with a 58mm width, install the supplied paper guide inside the printer. \nThe way you insert paper is important. Insert the paper roll with the paper edge pulling towards the floor rather than the ceiling. See the illustration below: \nPull the end of the paper straight out and over the front of the printer and push down on both sides of the printer cover to close. \nConnecting to Device through WPS \nNow that you have the printer set up, it's time to connect it to your network. On the back of the printer and under the wire cover, press and hold the  PAIR  button until the blue LED light starts flashing. \nPress the WPS button on your router. When the printer connects to the network, it will print the connection information, and the blue LED light will change from flashing to solid. \n \n Note \n If a connection cannot be made, just follow the next steps. \nConnecting to Device Manually \nNote \n If WPS failed, go through these steps. \nFirst, make sure the printer is turned off, then perform a self-print to get the MAC address of the printer. \nTo perform a self-print, press and hold the  FEED  button. Do not let go, but then turn the power on. Take your finger off the FEED button when self-printing has begun. \nOn this printout, you can check the MAC address from \"Network Configuration.\" \nBack on your Android device, go to the  Settings  screen, tap Wi-Fi , and make sure it is toggled ON. \nFrom the device list that appears at the bottom, refer to the last 6 digits of the MAC address, then tap the  device  to connect. \nOnce connected, \"Connected, no internet\" will appear under the SSID indicating that the connection is established. \n \n Note \n When connecting with this method, Internet access is not available on that device. \nOpen your device's web browser, such as Safari, and enter  192.168.10.1  in the address field. \n (If the IP address of the printer was changed, enter the IP address that appears under \"Current IP Parameters Status\" on your test print). \nIn the upper left-hand side of the screen, tap the  More  (3 lines) menu, then tap Login . \nLog in with the following credentials. \n  Name : root /  Password : public \nThe following message is displayed when you are using the default password.  DO NOT CHANGE THE PASSWORD . Tap Cancel to keep the login information the same. \nYou will be prompted to change your password after logging in,  DO NOT CHANGE YOUR PASSWORD . After login, click WLAN Settings . \nSelect  Infrastructure Mode , enter your internet's  SSID  and  Security Key  and click Submit to connect the printer to your network. Make sure to set  Security  as  WPA2/AES . \nWhen you click Submit , you will be prompted to click Save .  Do not click Save at this step.  \nClick IP Parameters . \nSelect Static . \nEnter the  IP Address ,  Subnet Mask , and  Default Gateway.  \n The IP Address, Subnet Mask, and Default Gateway that are shown in this image are an example. The local IP address is the one your router assigns to your device and uses to communicate with your network. A static IP address may be IPv4 or IPv6 in your network profile information. \n To access the local IP address on your Android device, navigate to Settings → Network &amp; Internet → Wi-Fi . You will see the settings icon next to the Wi-Fi network name. Tap  Settings , then tap  Advanced . Scroll down to locate the IP Address, Subnet Mask, and Default Gateway. \nClick Submit . \nClick Save . \nClick Execute . \nYour printer will restart and will stay connected to your network. \nTest Print \nLet's test our setup by printing a receipt. Navigate to More → Reports \nTap Transaction List . \nRun the report, then tap a transaction. \nTap Receipt . \nConfirm and tap Print . If the printer is connected correctly, it will print out the receipt. If not, refer back to the instructions on how to connect the device to the WiFi network. \nExample of a test print: \n",

You additionally can offer discounts based on a set number of visits as well as set specific  auto-renew  options. \n When you manage customer memberships from either the  Reports/Memberships  or  Customer Profile/Memberships  screens, changes you make affect ONLY that customer's use of the membership. Changes made on the  Settings/Memberships  page potentially affect all customers using that membership, depending on how the business implements a change. \n The options to edit or manage a customer's membership are the same once you get to the  Reports/Memberships  or  Customer Profile/Memberships  pages, so let's first navigate to the page you want. \n This article covers the following subjects: \nNavigation: Reports \nNavigation: Customer Profile \nEdit Membership \nEdit Balance \nPause/Resume Auto Renew \nCancel Membership \nRefund Membership \nMembership History \nNavigation - Reports &gt; Memberships \nClick Reports → Membership → Customers . \nConfigure  Search  options or run the report with the default settings. \n  Search Options : \nSearch Fields : Any, Customer, Membership Name \nSearch Value : enter text or numbers \nStatus : All, Active, Inactive, Paused, Cancelled \nClick Run Report . \n  \n Information on the  Memberships Report  is presented in the following columns. \n Customer, Membership Card ID, Membership Name, Price, Reward Points, Charge Frequency, Started Date, Next Payment Date, Remaining Auto Renewal, Status \nClick the  Action  drop-down menu for editing options. \n Depending on the type and status of the membership, you'll see some or all of these options: \nEdit Membership \nEdit Balance \nPause Auto Renew (if active) \nResume Auto Renew (if paused) \nCancel membership \nHistory \nNavigation - Customer Profile &gt; Memberships \nClick the  Customers  tab, select a customer from the drop-down list (or search the customer's name), and then click Memberships from the tabs on the customer profile page. \nInformation on the  Customer Profile / Memberships  page is organized into the following columns: \n Purchase Date, Membership ID, Membership, Service Provider, Amount Paid, Charge Frequency, Remaining Auto Renewal, Pts Gained, Starting Balance, Current Balance, Status \n Access the \"more actions\" menu by clicking the  Action  menu (3 vertical dots) in the last column. \nClick the  More  (3 vertical dots) menu for editing options. \n Depending on the type and status of the membership, you'll see some or all of these options: \nEdit Membership \nEdit Balance \nPause Auto Renew (if active) \nResume Auto Renew (if paused) \nRefund Membership \nCancel Membership \nHistory \nMaking Changes to the Customer's Membership \nEdit Membership \n \n You can make changes to the following settings for a customer's membership from the  Edit Membership  screen. \n \n Note \n  Edit membership  is not an option for memberships that are  Paused  or  Inactive . \nMembership Card ID number \nMembership - if you change the membership, you will be taken to a checkout screen to complete the transaction \nCharge Frequency - select from the renewal period options \nDescription (view only) \nPrice \nPayment Date \nReward Points (view only) \nToggle Auto-Renew on or off \nAuto Renew Limit : Set to a number of renewals after which the membership cannot be renewed again, or set to  Unlimited  \nCarry Balance Forward : Check this box to carry the remaining visits from the current cycle to the next \nDiscount Initial Payments : This option can only be edited while checking out a membership purchase or when creating or editing a membership from the  Settings/Memberships  page. \nFamily &amp; Friends : If the customer has Family &amp; Friends sharing, you can add members of their Family &amp; Friends list to this membership. \nFamily and friends that have not yet been added are shown as a gray button. \nFamily and friends that are part of the membership appear as a blue button \n You can add or remove a member by clicking the button for the member's name. \nWhen a membership has active Family &amp; Friends sharing, the Family &amp; Friends icon displays next to the membership name. \nEdit Balance \n \n You can edit the balance of remaining visits for services and classes in the membership and for the quantity of products that can be purchased using the membership. \nPause/Resume Auto Renew \n \n For memberships set to auto-renew, you can pause this feature from the  Action  or  More  menus.

You'll have to sell a new membership if the customer changes their mind about canceling. \n \n Important \n Cancelling a membership does not automatically refund the cost to the customer. You can refund a membership in one of two ways: \nRun a Transaction List report, locate the membership to refund, and select  Refund  from the  Action  menu. See Refund a Membership for detail. \nUse the  Refund Membership  option from the Customer Profile/Memberships page, see below. \nRefund Membership \n \n This option is only available from the  Customer Profile/Memberships  tab. When you choose this option, you can choose the refund options (to the customer's credit card, cash, or a gift certificate.) You can also select the option to cancel the membership at the same time you issue the refund. \nHistory \nYou can view a summary of all transactions for a membership by selecting History from the  Action  or  More  menus.

Because Forms are completely digital, they can be sent in many ways, making forms management easy for you and your customers. To learn more about our Forms feature, click here . \n Here are all the ways to send Forms to your customers: \nForm Mandatory When Booking \n \n You can require a form for specific services and classes or all your services and classes using the toggle for  Form is Mandatory When Booking  when creating or editing a form. You can also require customers to fill out a new form once or for every single visit by using the  Always Require Form  toggle. Now, when a customer books their appointment online, they will have to complete and submit the form before they can finalize the booking. \nTip \n Requiring a form when booking is recommended as there is no way for the customer to bypass filling out the form. It will be required to book an online appointment. \nSend A Form with Email Marketing \n \n You can create an email marketing campaign to send the form directly to your customer’s inbox. When creating or editing an email, you can add a  Buttons  module. This allows you to include the form link and adds a clickable button to the email so it’s simple for customers to locate. A  Before Visit  email marketing campaign will automatically send this email to your customers, so it is a great time saver. \nTip \n Sending your form by email is also a great way to send a reminder about specific rules or guidelines prior to their appointment. \nEmbed Forms on Your Website \n \n Once you have created a form, you also have the option to Embed it into a website. When viewing the list of all of the forms you have created, you can click the  Action  menu (3 vertical dots) next to the form you want to use on your site, then select Embed in Website . You will be shown a pop-up, where you will need to click Copy Code . Take that code and paste into your website to provide another convenient way for your customers to complete their Forms. \nTip \n This is a great way to create an intake form on your website. \n \n  Share Link  \n You have the option to copy the link to your form and then share that link anywhere you can paste it. You can share the link in a text message, a Facebook post, or to any other social media sites you use. Go to the list of your forms, click the  Action  menu (3 vertical dots), and select Copy Link . Now you can share the link in any way you like. \nTip \n This is a great way to get feedback via a survey. Try pasting the link to social media to maximize the feedback in a short amount of time. \nSend Forms From the Calendar or Checkout Screen \n \n If a customer arrives for their appointment without completing their form, there is a contactless way to send it to their personal device via the calendar or the checkout screen. \nOn the  Calendar  screen, click the customer’s appointment, then select Edit . Click Send to Customer on the popup note. \nAlso on the  Calendar , when you hover over an appointment, the status pop-up displays a link to fill out the required forms. \nOn the  Checkout  screen, you'll see a popup note with choices to fill out the form or  Send to Customer  send it to the customer’s device. \nTip \n This is a great way to safely send last-minute required forms to customers. \n",

Tap Apply after making your selections. \nTap Run Report on the filters selection screen to run the report. \nSwipe left on a transaction entry and then tap  Refund . \nMulti-Location Businesses: \n  If your current location is not the one that made the transaction you're refunding, you'll see this message: \nVagaro Pro app  \nWeb  \nClick Switch to Location . This changes your location to the one that issued the transaction. Now you can locate the transaction and complete the refund process in that business. \nOn the refund page, all items that were part of the transaction are shown. \n Be sure to select just the  Gift Certificate  item to refund by tapping  Refund  right beneath the gift certificate entry. \n  \n The  Refund Amount  will be pre-filled with the gift certificate balance - the original purchase amount minus any purchases made with the certificate since it was issued.

So, for example, if the GC was purchased for $100 and the recipient has used it for a $25.00 purchase, but the GC amount was manually increased to $95.00, the refundable amount will still be $75.00 ($100 - $25.00). \nYou can refund only part of the balance and leave a balance on the gift certificate if you want, or accept the default of refunding the entire remaining balance.

  "body": " \n When searching in Vagaro, your logo image is the first visual a potential client sees, so it is important that you choose a great image that attracts more customers. To present your business in its best light, we suggest you partner with a Photographer or Graphic Designer. Click here to order a custom logo from one of our Graphic Designers. If this is not possible, here are some tips for choosing a great logo image. \nChoose a shot of your studio space, a photo of your work, a portrait of your staff, or your business logo.  \n These subjects will best represent your business to potential clients. \nIt should be high quality.  \n High resolution, sharp, and not blurry. \n  \n The left image is low resolution and, therefore, blurry. To ensure a high-quality image, upload an original file under 5MB that is at least 1000 x 667 pixels. \nIt should be horizontal orientation or crop well into the designated 3x2 ratio.  \n A horizontal image crops best within the designated 3x2 ratio; however, some vertical photos can also fit. \n  \n In this vertical portrait, the subject's lovely features are cropped off. \n  \n No valuable information is cropped off in this vertical portrait. \n  \n This horizontal portrait is an excellent example of a well-cropped logo image - the entire image crops within the designated 3x2 ratio. \nTake your photo in natural, soft light.  \n You can achieve soft light in front of a window or outside in the shade. \n  \n Moving to the shade softens the subject's features. \n  \n This lighting is too harsh. Direct sunlight creates unflattering shadows. \nUse text sparingly.  \n Your business name is the only text needed on your logo image. Your business information is on your Vagaro page, so there is no need to display it on your logo image. \n  \n The text on the left image does not distract from the image, while the text on the right image does. Business information is unnecessary on a logo image. \nNo distracting backgrounds. We want your work to be the focus.  \n Photograph your subject against a wall, a simple background, or blurred background. \n  \n The cars in the background distract from the subject. \n  \n The subject pops against the clean background. \nDo not use a collage.  \n You have a small amount of space to entice customers, so choose one great visual that will invite them to your page. \nPlace your logo on a 3x2 canvas.  \n ( Hint: 1280 x 1920-pixels is a 3x2 ratio ) \n A cropped logo looks unprofessional. \n  \n This logo does not fit within the 3x2 ratio. \n  \n This logo was placed on a 3x2 canvas, and now it fits within the entire frame. \nFollow these tips, and you will choose a stunning visual to represent your business! \nAdding Images to Your Venue Gallery \n \n To learn how to add photos to your  Venue Gallery , click this link: How to Add Photos to Your Venue Gallery and Portfolio in Vagaro. \n",

  "body": " \n \n This is Legacy Hardware \n The Credit Card Swiper is a legacy device that Vagaro no longer sells. If you are looking for how to pair your EMV reader, see the following articles: \nPair the EMV Reader with Vagaro Pro \nPair the EMV Reader with Mac or Windows \nTo troubleshoot a credit card swiper on an Android device, please follow the steps below: \nClean the reader \nMake sure credit card processing is set up correctly in Vagaro \nEnable microphone in Settings \nForce close any running apps \nUninstall and Reinstall Vagaro Pro \nUpdate Android OS \nIf you've completed these steps and the swiper is still not working, please call 1-925-464-1932, ext. 2 (in the U.S.), so we can go through additional troubleshooting steps.  \n Support numbers for other countries: \nAustralia : (02) 8319 9138 ext. 22 \nCanada : 778 897 2477 ext 2 \nUnited Kingdom : (020) 3876 9856 ext 2 \nClean the reader \n \n Over time the magnet in the reader may get dirty. The tinting on some wallets may rub off on the client's card, which can rub off on the magnet. A quick way to clean it is to get a paper towel and fold it enough so it fits in the slit. Then slightly dampen it with a small amount of rubbing alcohol (preferred) or glass cleaner. Don't soak it. Rub it back and forth between the slit. This may take a couple of times. After you have cleaned it, try again. \nMake Sure Credit Card Processing is Set Up Properly on Vagaro \nClick Settings . \nSelect Credit Card Processing . \nEnsure that this page is  Enabled  and your name is under the Merchant Account section. If it states \"Awaiting Approval,\" the merchant account still needs to be approved, and you must wait for it to go through. \nRemember, if you're having problems swiping a credit card, you can enter the credit card information manually. However, this transaction is subject to higher, key-entered rates. \nEnable Microphone in Settings \n \n When using the Vagaro Pro credit card reader on your Android device for the first time, Vagaro Pro will need to access the microphone setting to recognize the signal from the reader. \n To make sure this setting is enabled, please follow the instructions below. \nGo to your phone Settings . \nGo to Apps \nClick Vagaro Pro \nGo to Permissions \nMake sure Microphone is enabled. \nForce Close Any Running Apps \n \n If you're still experiencing issues with the reader, we suggest closing all running apps, including Vagaro. \nClick the square icon at the bottom of the device. Then swipe the apps away (including Vagaro). \nUninstall and Reinstall Vagaro Pro \n \n If the credit card reader still doesn't work after setting up microphone access and closing all apps, delete the Vagaro Pro app. \nHold the Vagaro Pro icon and then drag it to Remove . \nAnother way is to find Vagaro Pro on the app store and then click Uninstall . \nAfter the app is uninstalled, hold the Power button together until it turns off on its own. This will not delete any of your device's data. It will just restart your device. \nAfter your device reboots, go to the Play Store and Install the Vagaro Pro app. \nUpdate Android OS \n \n Please make sure you are running the current OS on your Android device. \nGo to your phone Settings . \nGo to About Phone . \nClick System Updates . \nClick Check for Update . \n  \n If there is a pending update, please install it and then try again. \n",

The merchant statement only includes credit card transactions. \nQuickBooks Integration in Vagaro \n \n Remember, you first have to link your Vagaro Account with the QuickBooks platform.

To get started, click Sales . Then select All Sales . Remember, a transaction is added as either an  Invoice  or  Payment . An invoice is a payment that is requested. A payment is a payment that is received. \nMapping Vagaro Product and Service Sales in QuickBooks \n \n To see all product and service sales, click Products and Services from the  Sales  page. \n This data is added to the  Vagaro Payment  and  Income Account  by default. All service, product, class, membership, and package sales are created as separate items. This information is then mapped in QuickBooks. \n To change the details of an item, click the blue  Edit  option that corresponds to it on the right side of the screen. This allows you to adjust the historical data of that specific transaction. Let's take a closer look at this! \n Once you click Edit , you can change a few details about the transaction, including: \nThe name of the service. \nThe  SKU  number.

If you're not signed up with Vagaro, Try it Free for 30 Days. \n  Take Pictures of Your Work  \n To feature your business on social media, we need a photo to post! Photograph your finished work and remember our Portfolio Image Tips while taking the photo. Simple things to remember are: keep the background simple (like a wall or texture), use natural or \"soft\" looking light, and only upload photos that showcase your work and belong to you. \n  Upload Images to your Vagaro Portfolio  \n Upload your photos to your portfolio in your Vagaro account. Make sure you're uploading a high-resolution image; if the image is low-resolution it will not be featured. The photos you upload into your portfolio will be showcased on your listing page regardless if the image was approved or denied to be featured on the Vagaro gallery. \n  Get Your Image Approved  \n If you followed all the portfolio guidelines, chances are your image is now approved and featured on the Vagaro gallery in your area. Once your image is approved, we will pin and feature it on one of our Pinterest boards . The pins to our Pinterest board are linked to your Vagaro account, which helps customers find your business and book an appointment or class with you. From there, our team picks the images that fit best with our social media brand and style. \n  Get Featured  \n If your image is selected to be featured, we post it on our Instagram , Facebook &amp; Twitter pages. We always do our best to tag you and your business' Instagram and Facebook accounts, but sometimes they can be hard to find. To ensure that you get attributed, fill out your social links in your Vagaro profile . This will lead us directly to your social media accounts. \n  Be Patient  \n We collect customer images over time and post them when we feel the image fits best with our social media feed. Unfortunately, we can't guarantee that the images will be posted within a certain timeframe, even if we have decided to feature your business. \n",

The Vagaro team will make edits to the images for lighting, color, and other purposes when necessary, but if the description is unrelated to the service being showcased, it will be denied. Your portfolio images will post automatically to your page, and if you follow these guidelines, they may also be showcased on Vagaro’s Gallery. Only images related to Salon, Spa, and Fitness services will be approved. \n The guidelines below are here to help you get your images featured, but we reserve the right to deny images for other reasons. \nDo \nClearly, state the service you are showcasing. \nUpload a high-resolution image. \nUse a simple wall or background. \nPhotograph your subject using natural-looking light that is not harsh and bright enough to see the style. \nOnly show your styles using people. No dogs or mannequins, please. \nGive enough room in the photo to show the entire style, but also make sure the style is close enough to be visible. \nDon't \nDo not use flash, please! Flash creates a bright spot on the subject, creating harsh-looking light. \nCluttered backgrounds make for confusing photos \nLeave the frames out. We want to showcase your work, not a frame. \nPutting text or a logo on top of your images is not only distracting but all of your info is already posted with your portfolio images. \nWe want to see YOUR work, so no stock or stolen images. \nYour portfolio should only be images of services. Photos of your business or logo belong in the Venue Gallery. \nBe proud of your portfolio, so no blurry or poor-resolution photos. \nNo need for collages. You can add up to three images and create as many portfolio images as you want. \nNo nudity or graphic content. \nAdding Images to Your Portfolio \n \n To learn how to add photos to your  Portfolio , click this link: Add Photos to the Venue Gallery and Portfolio. \n",

  "body": " \n To troubleshoot the credit card swiper on an  iPhone  or  iPad , go through the following steps: \nClean the reader \nMake sure credit card processing is set up properly on Vagaro \nEnable microphone in Settings \nDisable the mono audio, EQ, and Volume Limit options \nForce close any running apps \nUninstall and Reinstall Vagaro Pro \nUpdate Apple iOS \nIf you've completed these steps and the swiper is still not working, please call 925-464-1932, ext. 2 (in the U.S.), so we can go through additional troubleshooting steps.  \n Support numbers for other countries: \nAustralia : (02) 8319 9138 ext. 2 \nCanada : 778 897 2477 ext 2 \nUnited Kingdom : (020) 3876 9856 ext 2 \nRemember, the mobile credit card reader works with an iPhone 7 and later models. However, you will need to use the Lightning to Headphone adapter. \nClean the Reader \n \n Over time, the magnet in the reader may get dirty. The tinting on some wallets may also rub off on the client's card, which can rub off on the magnet. A quick way to clean it is to get a paper towel and fold it enough so it fits in the slit. Then slightly dampen it with a small amount of rubbing alcohol (preferred) or glass cleaner. Don't soak it. Rub it back and forth between the slit. This may take a couple of times. After you have cleaned it, swipe the card again. \nMake Sure Credit Card Processing is Set Up Properly on Vagaro \nClick Settings. \nSelect Credit Card Processing . \nMake sure that this page is  Enabled  and your name is under the Merchant Account section. If it states \"Awaiting Approval\", the merchant account still needs to be approved, and you must wait for it to go through. \nIf a problem with the credit card or your card reader prevents you from swiping, you can manually enter the credit card information. Note that your transaction will be subject to higher, key-entered rates. \nEnable Microphone in Settings \n \n When using the Vagaro Pro credit card reader on your iPhone or iPad device for the first time, Vagaro Pro will need to access the microphone setting to recognize the signal from the reader. \n To make sure this setting is enabled, please follow the instructions below. \nGo to the Settings icon on your device. \nClick Privacy and then Microphone . \nTo enable microphone access for the Vagaro Pro App , click the switch to enable (green.) \nPlug in the reader and try to swipe again. Make sure you do not have any cover on your iPhone or iPad. This prohibits the device from being inserted completely. \nDisable Mono Audio \n \n To disable the  Mono Audio , go to your Settings on your phone. Tap General . Tap Accessibility . Then make sure the Mono Audio option is turned off. \nDisable the EQ and Volume Limit Options \n \n To disable the  EQ  and  Volume Limit  options, go to Settings on your phone. Tap Music . Then make sure the EQ and Volume Limit options are turned off. \nForce Close Any Running Apps \n \n If you've updated your Authorize.net API Login and Transaction key and it is set up on Vagaro, you may also want to consider forcing apps on your iPad / iPhone to close. \nDouble tap Home . \nSwipe up on each running app to close it fully. Once they are all closed, you will be left with just the home page. \nUninstall and Reinstall Vagaro Pro \n \n If the credit card reader still doesn't work after setting up microphone access and closing all apps, the next step is to delete the Vagaro Pro app. \nHold the Vagaro Pro icon for a couple of seconds until the apps start to wiggle. \nClick on the X and then Delete . \nAfter the app is uninstalled, hold the Home and Power button together until you see the Apple icon appear. This will not delete any of your device's data. \nAfter your iPhone / iPad reboots, reinstall the Vagaro Pro app in the App Store and try it again. \nUpdate Apple iOS \n \n Please make sure you are running the current iOS on your iPhone / iPad. You can check what iOS you're running on your iPhone / iPad by going to  Settings / General / Software Update . It will tell you if you have the current version or need to update it. Update it if necessary. \nGo to the Settings icon on your device. \nClick General and then Software Update . \n  \n If there is a pending update, please perform the update and try using the reader after it is done. \n",

If that customer does not respond within your set period, the opening is offered to the next highest-paid appointment. \nFirst in Line : An automatic notification is sent to the first customer on the waitlist. If that customer doesn't respond within the period you set, a notification goes to the customer who is next in line. \nInstant Book : An automatic notification is sent to all wait-list customers. The first to book gets the appointment. \nNote \n You can set  Customers Can Add to Waitlist  on or off for any waitlist type. When turned on (green), customers using your online booking page can add themselves to a waitlist if they can't find the appointment time they want. \nYou Pick \n \n Manually select a customer from the waitlist and add them to an open slot on the calendar. \n  Example:  Let's say Sara, one of your employees, gets an account notification that five waitlist appointments can fill a 120-minute slot. \n Sara would manually add the customer by selecting the  Add Now  button from the  Notification   Panel . This prompts the system to notify the customer, confirming they got the appointment. \n To set  You Pick  as your waitlist type, tap it in the Waitlist section and then tap  Save . \nMoney Maker \n \n The customer with the highest-paid appointment on the waitlist is automatically offered the opening slot first. If a customer does not respond within the period you set ( Time to Respond ), the opening is offered to the next highest-paid appointment. \n You can set the response period in the fields under  Time to Respond  for days, hours, and minutes. \n  Example:  Let's say we have these five waitlisted appointments for a 60-minute opening in the calendar: \nWendy - $30 haircut / 30 minutes \nHelen - $40 haircut / 30 minutes \nDoris - $285 haircut / 150 minutes \nJodi - $40 haircut / 30 minutes \nGretchen - $85 haircut / 60 minutes  \nThe earliest available time goes to  Gretchen  because she has the highest-paid appointment that fits into the time slot. \n Although Doris has the highest-paid appointment, the duration of her service is too long and does not fit within the available time. \n To set up  Money Maker  as your waitlist type: \nSelect Money Maker . \nIn  Time to Respond , set how long the customer has to respond before the appointment is offered to the next customer on the list. \nTap Save . \nFirst in Line \n \n With  First in Line , an automatic notification is sent to the first customer on the waitlist. If a customer does not respond within the period you set ( Time to Respond ), the opening is offered to the next customer in line. \n You can set the response period in the fields under  Time to Respond  for days, hours, and minutes. \n  Example:  Let's say Wendy was the first to be added to the waitlist. She receives the first notification. If Wendy does not respond within the period you set, the appointment will be offered to the next customer in line. At this point, both Wendy and the second customer can book the appointment. \n To set up  First in Line  as your waitlist type: \nTap First in Line . \nIn  Time to Respond , set how long the customer has to respond before the appointment is offered to the next customer on the list. \nTap Save . \nInstant Book \n \n A notification is sent to all customers on the waitlist. The first customer who books the appointment gets it. The customer will receive a push, email, and text notification with a link to the online booking page. \n To set  Instant Book : \nTap Instant Book . \nTap Save . \n2-Add Customers to a Waitlist from the Calendar \nNavigate to your  Calendar  page. \nTap any empty spot on the day you want, and then tap Add to Waitlist . \n  \n On the  Add to Waitlist  screen, fill in the following as needed: \nSelect the  Customer  to add to the waitlist. \nSelect the  Service . \n You can add up to 3 services here. Once you've added the first, tap +Add Service to add more. \nSelect Employee . \n  \n The default is the employee whose calendar you are showing, but you can select additional employees or use  Select All  to include all employees who offer the selected service. \n \n Note \n If multiple services are selected, you must make individual employee selections for each. \nSelect up to 5 dates. \n  \n You can remove additional services and date/time entries by tapping the minus symbol next to an entry. \n Tap Select Date Time to add more. \n Select a date from the pop-up calendar and then a time range (Anytime, Morning, Afternoon, or Evening). Tap Done on each to save the selections. \nAdd an  Appointment Note , if wanted. \nTap Add to Waitlist when you've configured the entries as needed. \n3-View Waitlisted Customers in the Notifications Panel \nTap the bell icon for  Notifications . \nFind and tap the  Waitlist  notification option. \n  \n There are two types of  Waitlisted Appointments : \nReady Appointments : when Waitlisted appointments become available, they will be listed here. \nCustomers on Waitlist : these are appointment requests made for days without employee/service availability. \n  \n The blue bell icon with a customer's name shows that a notification has been sent to the customer and the date and time sent. \n4-Book a Customer into an open slot on the Waitlist \n \n There are three options for each waitlist entry:  Remove ,  Call  the customer, and  Browse Availability . \nTap Remove to remove the customer from the  Waitlist . \n Confirm in the dialog that displays. \nTap the customer's phone number to contact them directly. \nTap Browse Availability to check for any openings in your schedule and add the waitlisted customer to an appointment. \n  \n You can change the service (or add more services), employee, and date. \nTap Search to view available appointments for the selected day. \nSelect a  Time . \nMake any changes to the  New Appointment  screen, and then tap Book . \n  \n You can see that the waitlisted customer has been added to the  Calendar . \n5-Restrict Employee use of the Waitlist feature \n \n To restrict an employee's access to the waitlist feature on the notification panel, follow these steps: \nTap  More  and navigate to Settings → Employees → Access Levels . \nSelect an employee type, tap the  More  (3 vertical dots) menu, and tap Edit . \nScroll down to the following settings: \nAccept Appointment Requests and Waitlists \nAccept Other Employee Appointment Requests and Waitlist \nEach has a button marked  Modify . Toggle it on or off. Green means that the option has been enabled for the employee. \n See Setting Access Levels - Vagaro Pro app to learn more about access levels. \nTap Save . \n",

We offer many ways to customize your commission, from paying per service or product to tiered percentages or dollar amounts. \n  Gusto integration is only available to US customers.  \n To sign up for your 3-month free trial of Gusto, click here . \n \n Note \n To close out the payroll and add it to the Payroll History Report , you have to mark it as paid. Click here for more information. Also, note that the payroll is based on the  Appointment Date , not the date that a transaction is  Checked Out  or  Completed . \nSet Your Payroll Frequency \n \n  To set up payroll, follow the steps below. \n \n Navigating to Payroll Configuration on the Pay Desk/iPad \n Payroll configuration is only available on the Web, Pay Desk, and iPad versions of Vagaro. The screenshots below display the Web screens, which are similar. \n To navigate to Payroll Configuration, tap Reports , then tap Payroll Configuration . \nClick Reports . \nClick Payroll Configuration under  Employees . \nSelect your  Payroll Frequency  (how often you pay your employees.) \n  \n You can pay employees  Weekly ,  Every Other Week ,  Monthly , or  Twice Per Month  (on the 15th of each month and the last day of the month). \n \n Note \n If you use the Gusto integration, your Vagaro Payroll Frequency must match the Pay Schedule settings in Gusto. Click here for more information. \nSet Payroll Frequency to Weekly \nSet a  Payroll Closing Day . \n  \n The set day of the week will determine when your payroll closes every week. For example, if  Payroll Closing Day  is set to  Mon , your payroll will close every Monday. \n  Below the  Payroll Frequency  option, you can see how  Overtime  pay is calculated based on your state's laws. \nSee State Overtime Laws for more information. \n  For users outside of the United States, you will be asked to enter the hours under  Overtime begins after  to set when overtime hours begin for your employees. Then enter the multiplier below  Overtime hourly multiplier . This multiplies the employee's hourly rate by the number you've entered. Remember, the multiplier applies only to daily pay . \nSet Payroll Frequency to Every Other Week \nSet your  Payroll Closing Day  and  Payroll Ending Day . \n  \n  Your Payroll Closing Day will be the day of the week your payroll ends, and the Payroll Ending Day is the last date of the current Payroll period. These settings determine the hours worked for payroll purposes. \n  For example, if your first payroll ending date is Friday, the 14th, the payroll period for hours worked will be the 1st-14th. The next payroll period will be the 15th-28th, ending Friday the 28th. Payroll will continue every other Friday. \n  Below the  Payroll Frequency  option, you can see how  Overtime  pay is calculated based on your state's laws. \nSee State Overtime Laws for more information. \n  For users outside of the United States, you will be asked to enter the hours under  Overtime begins after  to set when overtime hours begin for your employees. Then enter the multiplier below  Overtime hourly multiplier . This multiplies the employee's hourly rate by the number you've entered. Remember, the multiplier applies only to daily pay. \nSet Payroll Frequency to Twice Per Month \nIf you selected the Twice Per Month option, payroll will always end on the  15th and Last Day  of each month. \n  With  Twice Per Month  selected, you will not be able to run payroll for hourly pay rates. We are not responsible for determining your employee's overtime hours based on the hours worked. This is because overtime occurs after hours worked in a day or total hours worked in a week. Not all calendar months have the same number of weeks or days in them; therefore, we cannot calculate hours and overtime hours worked for these odd months. \nSet Payroll Frequency to Monthly \nIf you selected Monthly , your payroll will always end on the final day of the month. \n  With the  Monthly  payroll frequency selected, you will not be able to run payroll for hourly pay rates. We are not responsible for determining your employee's overtime hours based on the hours worked. This is because overtime occurs after hours worked in a day or total hours worked in a week. Not all calendar months have the same number of weeks or days in them; therefore, we cannot calculate hours and overtime hours worked for these odd months. \nConfigure Payroll Settings \nToggle Include Tips on (green) after considering the following: \nSelect  Include Tips  if you want to include all tips in the payroll, including cash and credit card tips. \nSelect  Include Tips  if you allow employees to take cash tips but pay them for credit card tips at payroll. In this case, do not enter cash tips at the checkout screen. \nDo not select  Include Tips  if your employees are taking cash tips on the day that the service is completed. \nSelect Deduct Service/Class Cost if you want to deduct the service cost from the sales price of the service. \n  \n For example, let's look at a cut and color service. The service is $75, and it costs, on average, around $5 dollars to complete the service (the cost to the business). If you subtract the cost to business, the net for the service is $70. The system will see this and only give service providers a commission on the $70 net gain instead of the $75 sales price. \n \n Note \n If the business cost exceeds the commission amount, the commission for the service will be $0. \nSelect Deduct Product Cost to deduct the product cost from the sales price. \n  \n For example, let's say you have a product that costs $2, and the sales price is $20. If you subtract the cost to business, the net for the product will be $18. The software will see this and only give service providers a commission on the $18 net gain instead of the $20 sales price. \nSelect Deduct Discounts to subtract the sales discount from the service price when calculating commission. \n  \n Here's an example that highlights this feature. Let's say you are a business owner offering a 50 percent discount on haircuts for a weekend. If this option is selected, the employee will receive a commission on the discounted price, which is $15. If this option is not selected on a $30 haircut, the service provider will receive the full $30 commission. \nSelect Subtract Membership Discounts from Commission to deduct a membership discount when calculating the commission for each employee. \n  \n For example, if you have a product that is $50, but the membership discount is 25%, knocking the price down to $37.50, the employee will receive a commission based on the $37.50. If this option is turned off, the employee will make a commission on the initial $50 price. \nToggle Only Pay Hourly Rate or Commission On (green) to pay an employee with either commission or hourly pay. \nSelect Apply to all hourly pay rates . \n If the  commission earned  during a pay period exceeds the  total  hourly pay, the employee will  only  be paid in commission. If the  total  hourly pay during a pay periods exceeds the  commission earned , then the employee will only be paid their  hourly pay . \nSelect Apply to specific pay rates , then select the roles that you want this setting to apply to. \n If the total commission earned during a pay period exceeds the  total  hourly pay for the  selected  roles, the employee will  not  receive hourly pay  for those selected roles . If the  total  hourly pay for the  selected  roles exceeds the total commission earned, then the employee will only be paid their hourly pay with  no commission . \nSet Commission for Services \nTiered Commission by Revenue \nThis option allows you to customize multiple percentages or amounts based on how much an employee charges for a service. \n  Tiered Commission by Revenue is the default; service-specific commissions will override the revenue commission.  \nClick the  Services  tab on the Payroll Configuration screen. \n  \n The  Tiered Commission by Revenue  tab will be the default selection. \nAdd additional tiers by clicking + Add . Provide a top range for each tier and enter commission percentages per Employee. (You can also enter flat commission amounts.) \n For example, if you set a Tier 1 commission for sales between $0.00 and $99 and a Tier 2 commission for sales between $100 and $499, Anna MacKenzie, who sells $300 in Services within the Payroll period, would get the Tier 2 commission of 40% on all services performed within the pay period. If she sold $600, Anna would get the Tier 3 commission of 45% on all services performed within the pay period. You can add as many tiers as you need, giving you more control over how you pay your employees. This can be set up for  Services ,  Products , or  Classes . \nWhen you're filling a commission field, you have the option to copy left/right and up/down with the same rate or amount to other tiers or employees. \nYou can remove a tier entirely by hovering over it, then clicking the displayed trash icon. \nClick Save to save these payroll settings. \n  \n ONLY use Save and Run Payroll if you're ready to run the payroll at the same time you save the settings. \nCommission by Service \nThis option allows you to set a dollar or percentage commission for each service your employees perform. This gives your business more control over how much you pay your employees, including a way to offer an incentive for employees to upsell specific services. \n  Tiered Commission by Revenue is the default, and any service-specific commissions will override the revenue commission.  \n For example, you can set Tiered Commission by Revenue for all your employees, and you can have a specific higher commission for one specific service that you offer; you can do that by entering it in the Commission by Service tab for each employee. \nClick the  Services  tab on the Payroll Configuration screen, then select Commission By Service . \n Your list of Services will populate, so you can enter commission details for each one. \nSelect the Service Category to edit commissions. \nNow set the commission for an employee. \n  \n For  Miranda C,  we've entered a $10 commission for Makeup-Application. You can also set the commission to be a percentage of the service cost \nClick Save to save these payroll settings. \n  \n ONLY use Save and Run Payroll if you're ready to run the payroll at the same time you save the settings. \nNote \n You have the same fill left/right or up/down options as with other commission entry pages. \nNote \n If you set an employee's  Tiered Commission by Service  commission to $0.00, then they will automatically receive the percentage commission for services. If you would like to avoid this, zero out the commission percentage for that employee. \nSet Commission for Classes \nTiered Commission by Revenue \nThis option allows you to customize multiple percentages or amounts based on how much an employee charges for a class. \n  Tiered Commission by Revenue is the default; class-specific commissions will override the revenue commission.  \nClick the  Classes  tab on the Payroll Configuration screen. \n  \n The  Tiered Commission by Revenue  tab will be the default selection. \nAdd additional tiers by clicking +Add . Provide a top range for each tier and enter commission percentages per Employee. (You can also enter flat commission amounts.) \n For example, if you set a Tier 1 commission for sales between $0.00 and $99 and a Tier 2 commission for sales between $100 and $499, Anna MacKenzie, who sells $300 in Classes, would get the Tier 2 commission of 40% within the Payroll period. If she sold $600, Anna would get the Tier 3 commission of 45% within the Payroll period. You can add as many tiers as you need, giving you more control over how you pay your employees. This can be set up for  Services ,  Products , or  Classes . \nWhen you're filling in a box on one tier, you have the option to fill left/right and up/down with the same rate or amount to other tiers or employees. \nYou can remove a tier entirely by hovering over it, then clicking the displayed trash icon. \nClick Save to save these payroll settings. \n  \n ONLY use Save and Run Payroll if you're ready to run the payroll at the same time you save the settings. \nTiered Commission by Class Attendees \nThis option allows you to set a commission structure based on the number of attendees for an appointment or class.  You may only assign commission amounts on this tab; percentages are not allowed.  \nClick the Classes tab on the  Payroll Configuration  screen, then click Tiered Commission by Attendees . \nSelect an option for the types of attendees you'll pay commissions on: \nClick Check-In or Paid to give a commission to an employee if an attendee has checked in (marked as  Show ) or has paid for the service or class. \nClick Paid to give commission to an employee only if an attendee is marked as  Paid , meaning they have been checked out and paid for the service or class. \n  \n If you select  Paid  and the attendee is marked as \"Check-In\" but has not yet paid for the class, the employee will not receive a commission. \nClick Check-In to give commission to an employee if the attendee checked into the class or has been marked as  Show . \nSet the commission for an employee. Let's look at  Donna J  in the example below. We've entered $5 in the box under  No Show . This means Donna will receive 5 dollars if a customer does not attend an appointment or class. \nIn the next column, we've entered $15 in the box under  1-4 Attendees . This means Donna will earn 15 dollars in commission if at least one client makes it to the appointment or class. \nThe third column shows the commission for between 5 and 9 attendees. \n In this case, Donna will receive 25 dollars in commission if 5 to 9 customers participate in the class, but she will receive 35 dollars in commission once the class capacity reaches 10. \n She will receive 60 dollars in commission once the attendee list reaches 20, as we have assigned the 60-dollar commission to 20 or more attendees. \nClick Save to save these payroll settings. \n  \n ONLY use Save and Run Payroll if you're ready to run the payroll at the same time you save the settings. \nAs with the other entry fields for commissions, you can fill left/right or up/down and switch between amounts and percentages for each employee and rate column. You can remove rate tiers by hovering over one and clicking the trash icon to delete it. \nCommission by Class \nWhen you select the Commission by Class tab, you can set specific commission amounts for different classes and customize the amounts for each employee. Each instructor’s commission can be customized by an amount or percentage of the class revenue.  You may only assign commission amounts on this tab; percentages are not allowed.  \nClick the Classes tab and then Commission by Class . \nUsing the drop-down menu, you can select all or specific employees to display on the screen. Click Go to populate the table with your selections. \nSelect a  Class  category on the left side of the screen, then enter a commission amount for each employee for each class they teach. \n  \n You have the same fill left/right or up/down options as with other commission entry pages. \n  \n In the example above, Anna receives $20 for each Custom Spin class she teaches, Bijou receives $25, and Donna makes $10 for each class she teaches. \nClick Save to save these payroll settings. \n  \n ONLY use Save and Run Payroll if you're ready to run the payroll at the same time you save the settings. \nNote \n If  Commission by Class, Service, or Product  is set to any value greater than $0.00, it will override the  Tiered Commission by Revenue  and  Tiered Commission by Attendee . \nNote \n  Tiered Commission by Revenue  and  Tiered Commission by Attendee  will automatically combine in the payroll. If you do not wish to merge these commissions, set the value of one of the commission types to $0.00. This will result in the employee being paid for only one commission type. \nSet Commission for Products \nTiered Commission by Revenue \nThis option allows you to customize multiple percentages or amounts based on how much an employee charges for a product. \n  Tiered Commission by Revenue is the default; product-specific commissions will override the revenue commission.  \nClick the  Products  tab on the Payroll Configuration screen. \n  \n The  Tiered Commission by Revenue  tab will be the default selection. \nAdd additional tiers by clicking +Add . Provide a top range for each tier and enter commission percentages per Employee. (You can also enter flat commission amounts.) \n For example, if you set a Tier 1 commission for sales between $0.00 and $99 and a Tier 2 commission for sales between $100 and $499, an employee, who sells $300 in Products, would get the Tier 2 commission of 40% within the Payroll period. If she sold $600, they would get the Tier 3 commission of 45% within the Payroll period. You can add as many tiers as you need, giving you more control over how you pay your employees. This can be set up for  Services ,  Products , or  Classes . \nWhen you're filling in a box on one tier, you have the option to fill left/right and up/down with the same rate or amount to other tiers or employees. \nYou can remove a tier entirely by hovering over it, then clicking the displayed trash icon. \nClick Save to save these payroll settings. \n  \n ONLY use Save and Run Payroll if you're ready to run the payroll at the same time you save the settings. \nCommission by Product \nThis option allows you to set a specific commission for each product your employees sell. You can select a dollar or percentage amount. This gives you more specific control over how much you pay your employees when they sell retail products. \n  Tiered Commission by Revenue is the default, and any product-specific commissions will override the revenue commission.  \n For example, you can set Tiered Commission by Revenue for all of your employees and have a specific higher commission for one product. Do that by entering it in the Commission by Product tab for each employee. \nClick the  Products  tab on the  Payroll Configuration  screen, then select Commission by Product . \nSelect a  Brand  to edit. \nFor each product, enter an amount or percentage for the commission you will pay when an employee sells that product. \n For example, you could set an employee to get a 10% commission for every Redken All Soft Shampoo sold, while another employee gets $3 for her commission. \nManually enter commissions for each product or copy commission rates across all employees and/or products within that brand. \nSet Role-Based Hourly Pay for Your Employees \nWith role-based hourly pay, employers can assign pay rates to job roles set by the business. This allows for more flexibility in setting wages based on the responsibilities required for each role. \n When employees clock in, they can select a role specific to their job duties and responsibilities. After clocking out, the employee's pay will be automatically calculated based on the hourly rate assigned to the employee for that role. Role-based hourly pay can also be helpful for managing labor costs and budgeting, as employers can adjust pay rates for different roles and employees as needed to control expenses. Additionally, it can provide career progression and incentives for employees to develop new skills and take on additional responsibilities to earn higher pay rates. \nClick the  Hourly Pay  tab. \n  \n Existing pay rates set before  Role-Based Hourly Pay  are still saved. They are now set as the role:  Hourly Pay Rate . You can leave the current name or modify it as per your preference. \nClick + Add to create a new role. \nEnter a  Role Name  and  Hourly Pay Rates  for each applicable employee. \n  \n If you assign an employee a pay rate of  $0.00 , they won't be able to clock in for that role. Therefore, please ensure that employees do not have a pay rate assigned for a role they are not qualified for. \nClick Save . \nYour new  Role-Based Hourly Rates  are now configured. Your employees can now clock in for a specific role.

Also, you can compare the  Payroll  report with the  Transaction List  report for more information. \n If you haven't found the cause for the inaccurate information, please contact Vagaro support. \nDo I have to take money back from my employee when I refund customers? \nNo, refunds are deducted from the current payroll cycle. \n For example, if you refund a service that was purchased a month ago, any commission earned from that service is deducted from the employee's  Payroll Due  the next time you run payroll. \nWhen I close payroll, are my employees paid automatically? \nWell, that depends. \n Vagaro's payroll system is great for reporting purposes, but in order to send direct deposits to your employees with Vagaro, you will need to activate the Gusto integration. \nI'm going to be out of the country for a couple of weeks. Can I still run payroll? \nIf you are traveling outside of the US, Canada, UK, or Australia, you will not be able to sign in. When traveling outside of these regions, make sure that you have someone to run payroll for you, or you can access Vagaro with a VPN while traveling. \n",

  "name": "Prevent Chargebacks and Fraudulent Transactions",
  "body": " \n By using our best practices for credit card processing, you can protect yourself from chargebacks and fraudulent activities! \n There are two types of transactions: \nCard-Present  - this is when a customer presents a card in person, and you swipe, dip or tap the card to process it. \nCard-Not-Present  - this is when the credit card number is entered manually. Examples include online purchases and orders over the phone. \nLet's explore both of these in more detail! \nBest Practices for Card-Present Transactions (In-Person Orders) \n \n Firstly, always try to swipe, dip or tap a card during the point of sale. A card-present transaction typically has lower fees and is deemed less risky. Try to limit manual entries or typed-in transactions as much as possible. \n Secondly, make sure to follow the proper procedures when processing a transaction. If it's approved, ask the customer to sign the sales receipt. If it's declined, return the customer's card and kindly ask for a different form of payment or another credit card. \n Here are some additional practices to help reduce the likelihood of fraudulent transactions during in-store purchases: \nValidate the physical card  and make sure it has not been altered in any way. \nAsk for a signature  and make sure that the signature on the receipt is the same as the one on the card. \nBest Practices for Card-Not-Present Transactions (Typed-in or Online) \nVerify that the cardholder’s address matches the address that's on file at the customer's bank. Another thing you can do is verify the security code, which is found on the signature panel of the card. On  American Express  cards, you'll find this number on the front. If, at any time, you become suspicious of fraud, probe and ask the customer more questions. \nMake sure the customer receives a delivery item in a timely fashion. The transaction date should be the same as the date it was shipped and no greater than seven days from the date it was authorized. Do not charge a customer until the items have been shipped. \nTips to Prevent Chargebacks \nClearly inform customers about the return, refund, and cancellation policies at the time of sale \nProcess credits in a quick manner \nImmediately respond to requests to cancel recurring payments or when the customer specifies \nMake sure that the merchant name that appears on the customer's statement is clear to the customer. If not, let the customer know what to expect when viewing the credit card statement. \nTips to Prevent Fraud \n \n Remember, credit card fraud can occur at any time, whether a payment is being processed at your store location or from your online booking page. \n When identifying potential warning signs for fraudulent practices, be aware of customers who: \nPurchase a large number of items, disregarding size, style, color, or price \nPurchase a lot of items when the store closes \nPurchase many of the same items multiple times \nRequest an overnight or rush shipping of delivery items \nAre first-time shoppers \nMake in-store purchases using very similar card numbers \nPurchase a high volume of gift cards or services and ask for a cashier's check in return \n",

  "body": " \n Increase your earnings by quickly filling in last-minute cancellations. Take complete control over how you set your waitlist rules and maximize your appointment schedule with Vagaro's expanded and automated  Waitlist  feature. \n You have four waitlist options to choose from: \nYou Pick : Select a customer from the waitlist and book them into an open slot \nMoney Maker : Automatically notify the customer who has the highest-paid appointment \nFirst in Line : Automatically notify the first customer on the waitlist \nInstant Book : Automatically notify all customers on the waitlist. The first to book gets the appointment \nThis article will cover the following: \nCreate a Waitlist : \nYou Pick \nMoney Maker \nFirst in Line \nInstant Book \nAdd Customers to a Waitlist from the Calendar \nView Waitlisted Customers in the Notifications Panel \nBook a Customer into an open slot from the Waitlist \nRestrict Employee use of the Waitlist feature \nRelated Article : Create a Waitlist - Vagaro Pro app \n1-Create a Waitlist \nNavigate to Settings → Booking → Online Appointment Rules . \nScroll down to the  Waitlist  section. \n  \n You'll be able to choose from four  Waitlist  types: \nYou Pick : Manually select a customer from a waitlist and add them to an opening slot on the calendar from your  Notification Panel  when your schedule is full and a customer cancels. \nMoney Maker : An automatic notification is sent to the customer with the highest-paid appointment on the waitlist. If that customer does not respond within the period you set, the opening is offered to the next highest-paid appointment. \nFirst in Line : An automatic notification is sent to the first customer on the waitlist. If that customer doesn't respond within the period you set, a notification goes to the customer who is next in line. \nInstant Book : An automatic notification is sent to all wait-list customers. The first to book gets the appointment. \nNote \n For any waitlist type, you can set  Customers Can Add to Waitlist  on or off. When turned on (green), customers using your online booking page can add themselves to a waitlist if they can't find the appointment time they want. \nYou Pick \n \n Manually select a customer from the waitlist and add them to an open slot on the calendar. \n  Example:  Let's say Sara, one of your employees, gets an account notification that five waitlist appointments can fill a 120-minute slot. \n Sara would manually add the customer by selecting the  Add Now  button from the  Notification   Panel . This prompts the system to notify the customer, confirming they got the appointment. \n To set  You Pick  as your waitlist type, tap it in the Waitlist section and then tap  Save . \nMoney Maker \n \n The customer with the highest-paid appointment on the waitlist is automatically offered the opening slot first. If a customer does not respond within the period you set ( Time to Respond ), the opening is offered to the next highest-paid appointment. \n You can set the response period in the fields under  Time to Respond  for days, hours, and minutes. \n  Example:  Let's say we have these five waitlisted appointments for a 60-minute opening in the calendar: \nWendy - $30 haircut / 30 minutes \nHelen - $40 haircut / 30 minutes \nDoris - $285 haircut / 150 minutes \nJodi - $40 haircut / 30 minutes \nGretchen - $85 haircut / 60 minutes  \nThe earliest available time goes to  Gretchen  because she has the highest-paid appointment that fits into the time slot. \n Although Doris has the highest-paid appointment, the duration of her service is too long and does not fit within the available time. \n To set up  Money Maker  as your waitlist type: \nSelect Money Maker . \nIn  Time to Respond , set how long the customer has to respond before the appointment is offered to the next customer on the list. \nClick Save . \nFirst in Line \n \n With  First in Line , an automatic notification is sent to the first customer on the waitlist. If a customer does not respond within the period you set ( Time to Respond ), the opening is offered to the next customer in line. \n You can set the response period in the fields under  Time to Respond  for days, hours, and minutes. \n  Example:  Let's say Wendy was the first to be added to the waitlist. She receives the first notification. If Wendy does not respond within the period you set, the appointment will be offered to the next customer in line. At this point, both Wendy and the second customer can book the appointment. \n To set up  First in Line  as your waitlist type: \nClick First in Line . \nIn  Time to Respond , set how long the customer has to respond before the appointment is offered to the next customer on the list. \nClick Save . \nInstant Book \n \n A notification is sent to all customers on the waitlist. The first customer who books the appointment gets it. The customer will receive a push, email, and text notification with a link to the online booking page. \n To set  Instant Book : \nClick Instant Book . \nClick Save . \n2-Add Customers to a Waitlist from the Calendar \nNavigate to your  Calendar  page. \nClick any empty spot on the day you want, and then click Add to Waitlist . \n  \n On the  Add to Waitlist  screen, fill in the following as needed: \nSelect the  Service . \n You can add up to 3 services here.

  "name": "Getting Found in Google - SEO Best Practices",
  "body": " \n Google and other search engines (like Bing) are essential to anyone's business success. Customers like you have called in to ask about Vagaro's search engine optimization (SEO), so we've put together this handy guide for you. Keep in mind, however, that Google and other search engines are very much like ordinary people. Focus on doing what will help your customers, and your search engine traffic will grow. \n First, let's talk about the term \"SEO\" that you may have heard or read about. It stands for Search Engine Optimization. Here is a quick rundown of what it does: it is a set of tactics that can help you rank higher for queries when a potential client enters terms into Google or other search engines. \n Before we get to the tactics, keep in mind that there is no guarantee of getting to the top of any search engine's organic (non-paid) results. No company, software, agency, employee, or tool can guarantee any result. \n However, many things can help you do a better job of being found. \nKeywords \n \n Keywords are the words people put into a search engine when looking for something. Sometimes these words are abbreviations, slang, or very simplistic words. Think about how you look for something and what words you use. Those are the words you want to use throughout your Vagaro listings. \n \n Note \n Do not repeat the same word(s). This looks spammy to Google, and your page is less likely to rank. \nContent \n \n If you are looking to get more business through Google search, there are some things you can do to increase your chances of being found. \nYour Description \n \n First, you should fill out the description in your  Business Profile . Use words in the description that you think people will search in your local area to find a business like yours. Also, make it a well-thought-out, unique several paragraphs. Describe your business fully and thoroughly. This will build trust with new customers and help them get to know you. \n Here are a few questions to help you think about what to write: \nWhat makes you unique? \nWhat's special about your business? \nYour Services \n \n List your services or classes and describe them thoroughly. What makes your version of the service different than other stylists, massage therapists, estheticians, fitness professionals, etc.? Describe the process so that even new clients can understand what to expect from your service. \nYour Service Providers \n \n Vagaro recognizes that there is a special relationship between each service provider and client. For your service providers, each one should have unique descriptions about why a customer should book with him/her in their bio . Tell a unique story for each provider to help customers choose a good match for the service and provider. \nPortfolio \n \n Good content and user experience is important to search engines and to customers. One of the best ways to illustrate your expertise is by adding photos of your best work to your portfolio. Check out our photography best practices here . We also encourage you to photograph your venue to give your new customers a level of security before they visit your facility. \nCustomer Reviews \n \n Becoming an authority in your business, city, and niche is important to Google. The best way to illustrate this is to get reviews from your customers. Repeat that:  GET REVIEWS!  Ask your best customers to write up a short paragraph describing why they love you. These reviews must be from legitimate customers who are not paid for their reviews. \nOutreach \n \n Outreach is one of the most important parts of your marketing efforts. Outreach is getting websites to share links on social media or to add links to their websites from relevant content on their website that land on your Vagaro listing page. Earning links can take time but are worth the effort and can help you rank higher for terms that are relevant to your business. \nSocial Media \n \n Social media links are the easiest ones to earn and place. You should always link to your Vagaro Listing website from your Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook biography. Those are the larger 3, but you should link from any social media network you are actively engaging on. Do not register a MySpace account and link from it if you are never going to visit it. The profiles you link from should be actively managed and used. \n Another great idea is to have your friends and family share links to your booking pages from their social media. This should not be overdone and spammy, but there's nothing wrong with leaving a link when someone asks for a recommendation of where to get a service done. \nOther Websites \n \n The best links come from sites that are talking about your industry or business. Get a story on your local news site and ask them to link to you. See if there are any industry bloggers who want to write about your business or your industry and get a link from there. See if your Chamber of Commerce or other Business Clubs have websites that can link to you. (These are a few suggestions, but be creative.) \n \n Note \n NEVER BUY LINKS. EVER. \n Buying links is different than ads like Google Adwords or Facebook ads which are good for business. If anyone is offering to sell links for SEO, do not buy them. \nWhere Can I Find My Vagaro Website Link? \n \n You can use your Vagaro domain name or your private domain if you have one to list your business on the sites below. If you do not know your Personal Vagaro URL, you can find it by going to Settings → Business Profile . It is under  Vagaro URL . You can change this URL whenever you like and as many times as you want, but it is better to decide on and keep the same URL over time. \nHere are some ways to kickstart your link-building: \nCreate an account on Google my Business, so Google knows where you are located and has a link to your website and other information. Go to https://www.google.com/business/ to sign-up \nCreate a Yelp account http://www.yelp.com/writeareview/newbiz \nCreate an InsiderPages account http://insiderpages.com/session/new?header_link=true \nCreate a FourSquare account https://foursquare.com/signup/ \nCreate a YP.com account https://www.yellowpages.com/ \nCreate a Facebook Business Page https://business.facebook.com/ \nSign in to your Google account https://accounts.google.com/Login \nSign up for a Pinterest account https://pinterest.com/ \nStart a WordPress Blog - https://signup.wordpress.com/signup \nConsider having a Vagaro booking page built with a private domain so your business looks more professional when you are found. Here are the steps to take to do that: \nFor only $10 a month, Vagaro will host a customized Vagaro booking page for you that you can build yourself through our Website Builder . \n This allows you to customize the look and colors of your page. You can brand yourself and your business through this tool. If you don’t have time to create it yourself, for only $100, Vagaro offers a service to build it for you with personalized graphics and colors to match your business' style. \nThe second thing you can do is get your own domain name for your Vagaro website. \n Go to Vagaro Domains and register your domain name. Then email us at support@vagaro.com with your login information for your domain and your business name on Vagaro so we can forward your domain name to your Vagaro website. If you need any help, just call us at (800) 919-0157 x2. \n",

Once the membership is resumed, they will again be able to use the membership regularly. \nYou can manage Auto-Renewal for Memberships from three areas of the Vagaro application: \nReports → Memberships to pause or resume memberships for individual customers. \nCustomer Profile  to pause or resume memberships for individual customers. \n You can access these functions for Customer Profile in both the Web version and the Vagaro Pro app. \nSettings → Things We Sell → Memberships to pause or resume memberships for  ALL  customers. \nPause/Renew from Reports \nNavigate to Reports → Customers → Memberships . \nSet any search or filters you want and click  Run Report . \nFind the membership on the list, click Action , then select Pause . \nIn the pop-up dialog that displays, you can select an indefinite or temporary pause: \nSelect Pause Temporarily to pause for a number of billing cycles which you enter. \nWith a temporary pause, you can charge a different price for the membership while it is paused. \nAllow Continued Access  - Customers have access to benefits until the end of the current billing cycle.

If it was paused on April 18th, then resumed on May 10th, the membership would not be charged because the next billing date is not until May 15th. \n Whether the customer is charged immediately or at the next billing cycle when a membership is resumed depends on the type of pause: \nIf it was an  Indefinite  pause and resumed outside of the billing cycle, the customer is charged immediately. \nFor a  Temporary  pause, consider this example: \n A membership on a monthly renewal is paused for 2 billing cycles (at a discounted pause price) on April 18. If you resume the auto-renewal on May 20, the customer will be charged the regular price at the next billing cycle, June 15, because they had already paid the paused price for the month of May. \nNote \n On the checkout page, if any customer is being checked out and has a paused membership, you’ll get a prompt asking to resume the membership. \n",

  "body": " \n  Product History  provides two functions: \nView all events related to individual products in your inventory: sales, purchases, reductions in inventory due to loss, damage, expiration, or business use \nCorrect data entry errors for purchases, sales, and other inventory changes \nPrerequisites \n \n  Available for all Vagaro businesses.  \nProcesses \n \n First, we'll show you how to view the product history, then how to edit product history entries. \nView Product History \nNavigate to Settings → Inventory → Management . \nFind the product, click the  More  (3 vertical dots) menu, and then select History . \n  \n The  Product History  page shows: \nDate \nType - purchased, sold, refunded, and inventory reductions due to loss, damage, expiration, or business use \nReason - the reason selected for an inventory reduction \nVendor \nService Provider \nModified Date - the date the item history entry was changed \nModified By - the employee who made the history change \nCost \nSelling Price \nAmt Refunded \nQty - how many of this product were affected \nPoint Given - to the customer buying the product \nPoint Redeem - points used to purchase the product \nTax \nEdit - Click to edit this history entry \n \n Note \n There is no Edit option for a Refund entry. \nTo select a date range, you can enter From and To dates or use the calendar selections to set a date range. \nUse Select Type to filter the search by the type of event. If you make no selection, the search shows all types. \n  \n Click Search when you're finished. \nYou can export the result to an Excel spreadsheet or print a copy. \nTo leave the history screen, click the browser's  Back  button to return to the  Inventory  list. \nEdit Product History \nDid you or an employee make a mistake in entering a change to inventory? Does your history show that Employee A made the sale when it was actually Employee B? Did you select the wrong  Reason  or add an incorrect note when subtracting items from inventory? Incorrect adjustments made using the  Add  and  Subtract  functions could affect your reports, such as the  Inventory Summary  report. \n You can edit the product history to correct these mistakes. \nWhen you have brought up the product history screen, you'll see a column of  Edit  buttons, one for each history entry: \nClick Edit for the entry you want to edit. \n Your options on the edit screen depend on the type of event. \nPurchase  (or any addition to the inventory count): \nSold  - you can change only the Service Provider. \nLost, Damaged, Expired,  and  Business Use : \nRefund  - there is no edit option for a refund event. \nThere are Cancel and Submit buttons at the bottom of the history edit screens. \nNote \n A change to the item's  Tax Rate  may be confusing when viewed in history. \n In the example below, you see the item listed as both  No Tax  and with a tax rate of 9.25% for  Sold  and  Refund  events. The currently configured tax rate will display in the  Tax  column except when there was a different rate in effect for a product sale or refund. In the example, a product was both sold and refunded on March 25. The tax rate on the product was changed after the last refund event. Any future sales or refunds will reflect the  No Tax  status for this product. \nNext Steps and Recommended Features \nThis Feature Works Best With... \nWith Credit Card Processing activated, your customers can buy products through your online booking page. \n Vagaro offers competitive credit card processing rates and a wide range of other benefits, including selling services, products, memberships, and gift certificates online.

In cases where an employee is subject to both the state and federal overtime laws, the employee is entitled to overtime according to the higher standard (i.e., the standard that will provide the higher overtime pay). \n Extra pay for working weekends or nights is a matter of agreement between the employer and the employee (or the employee's representative).” \nTypes of Overtime \n \n The federal baseline for overtime is 1.5 x RRP (regular rate of pay) for all hours over 40 in a week. \nOvertime Type  \nHourly rate multiplier  \n  (RRP= Regular rate of pay)  \nWeekly overtime \n1.5 times RRP \nDaily overtime \n1.5 times RRP \nDaily double overtime \n2.0 times RRP \n7th consecutive day of any one work week \n1.5 times RRP \nState Overtime Laws \n \n Table last revised June 2021 \nState  \nOvertime Occurs After...  \nOvertime Calculation  \n (RRP = Regular rate of pay) \nExplanation  \nAlabama \nWeekly: 40 hours \nWeekly: 1.5 x RRP for all hours over 40 in a week. \nWeekly: Refer to FLSA definition. \nAlaska \nWeekly: 40 Hours \n Daily: 8 Hours \nWeekly: 1.5 x RRP for all hours over 40 in a week. \n Daily: 1.5 x RRP for all hours over 8 in a day. \nWeekly: Refer to FLSA definition. \n Daily: Employees who work more than 8 hours during any workday will earn overtime, paid at 1.5x their regular rate of pay for any time over 8 hours worked. \nArizona \nWeekly: 40 hours \nWeekly: 1.5 x RRP for all hours over 40 in a week. \nWeekly: Refer to FLSA definition. \nArkansas \nWeekly: 40 hours \nWeekly: 1.5 x RRP for all hours over 40 in a week. \nWeekly: Refer to FLSA definition. \nCalifornia \nWeekly: 40 hours \n Daily: 8 hours \n Daily Double OT: 12 hours \n 7th consecutive day: All hours \nWeekly: 1.5 x RRP for all hours over 40 in a week. \n Daily: 1.5 x RRP for all hours over 8 in a day. \n Daily Double OT: 2 x RRP for all hours over 12 a day. \n 7th consecutive day*: \n 1.5 x RRP for the first 8 hours of work on the 7th day of work in any workweek, regardless of the number of hours worked during the previous 6 days AND \n 2 x RRP for all hours over 8 on the 7th day. \nWeekly: Employees are eligible to earn overtime on a weekly basis.

To do both, you will create gift certificates without sales transactions. \nTransfer Gift Certificates from another system \nGo to Reports → Gift Certificates . \nClick New Gift Certificate . \nIf you have a plastic gift card to use, you can scan the bar code or swipe it to use the card number. Otherwise, you can enter a number or use the Auto Generate option to create one for you. \n Using the other system's gift certificate for reference, transfer information into this screen. \nService/Class : tie this gift certificate to a specific service or class. (Optional) \nAmount : If you don't tie the certificate to a service/class, enter the value. For a transfer, this would be the value remaining on the certificate at the time of transfer. \nExpire on : Select an expiration date using the calendar pop-up, or leave set at  Never . \nSender's Name : Start typing the name of a current customer, and it will fill in. The sender must already have a profile in Vagaro. \n \n Note \n A customer must have a profile when a gift certificate is created and issued. The profile must include at least a first and last name. \nNote \n If you may not always have a name to put into the  Sender  field, create a Customer Profile with your Business name or \"Gift Certificate.\" \nRecipient's Name : Start typing the name of a current customer, and it will fill in. Click  New  to create a new profile if the person does not have a customer profile. \n \n Note \n A customer must have a profile when a gift certificate is created and issued. The profile must include at least a first and last name. \nNote \n If you do not know the recipient's contact information, create a customer profile of \"Gift Certificate\" to use. A customer only needs to provide the gift certificate number at checkout to redeem it. \nMessage : Enter a message to be printed on the certificate. \nSelect Print Gift Certificate or Send email to: [recipient's name] to print or email a copy. \nSelect a template from the  Template Type  list. If you have created custom gift certificate templates, they will be listed under  Business Created . \nSelect the design from the available template images. \nClick Next for a preview of the gift certificate. \nClick Close to cancel the addition, Back to edit the gift certificate, or Add Gift Certificate to finish. \nCreate a Donation Gift Certificate \n \n You can follow the same steps used for the Transfer option to create a donation Gift Certificate. \nUse your \"business name customer\" as the sender. \nEither create a customer profile for the recipient (another business name customer) or use the same \"Gift Certificate\" customer described in step #3 above. \n",

If the client uses an account that is not tied to the business, they will not be able to review the service. \nAnother common error is clients create a separate account, not realizing you have created one for them. This is an issue because the customer logs into an account that is not assigned to the business. As a result, the client can't write a review. \nBe aware of how you set the customer review option on the  Online Appointment Rules  page in  Settings . If you only allow  verified customers  to write reviews, this limits reviews to clients with an appointment status of  Checked Out  or  Completed . \nTo email the username and password to a customer so they can leave a review, follow the steps below. \nClick Customers . \nSelect the customer. \nSelect the Profile tab. \nClick Send Login Info to email the username and password. \nClick Send Login Info to email the username and password they have on file. \n",

If the payment goes through successfully, the package status changes to \"active.\" If the transaction fails on Tuesday, the package will remain \"inactive.\" \n  Friday : Vagaro attempts to charge the card again. If it fails, the package will remain inactive until manually reactivated by the business. \nPause/Resume from Reports \nNavigate to Reports → Customers → Packages . \nGo to  Customers , then  Packages  on the sidebar menu, and click Run Report after adding the search filters you want to apply. \nFind the package on the list, and click Action , then select Pause . \nTip \n The circular arrow in the  No. of Visit(s) Remaining  column indicates a package that is set to auto-renew. \nSelect Pause Package to confirm. \n  \n The package's  Renewal Status  now shows as Paused : \nTo restart auto-renewal, find the package again and select Resume from the  Action  menu. \nSelect Resume Package to confirm. \nThe package  Renewal Status  shows as Active . \nPause/Resume from Customer Profile - Web version \nGo to Customers , select a customer and then select the Packages tab. \nClick the  More  menu (3-dots), and then click Pause Auto Renew . \nConfirm on the  Pause Package  pop-up screen. \nThe Status changes to  Paused . \nTo resume Auto Renew, select Resume Auto Renew from the same  More  menu. \nConfirm on the pop-up screen. \nPause/Resume from Customer Profile - Vagaro Pro app \nTap Customers , select a customer, and then scroll and tap the  Packages  tab. \nTap the package you want to pause, and then tap Pause Auto Renew . \n  \n The paused package is highlighted in yellow. \nTo resume Auto Renew, tap the paused package and then tap Resume Auto Renew . \nConfirm on the pop-up screen by tapping Resume Package . \nPause/Resume from Settings &gt; Packages \n \n From the main packages page, when you pause Auto Renew, you affect all customers that have that package. \n If a package has been paused this way, you can still resume auto-renew for individuals using that package from either the Reports/Packages or Customer Profile/Packages pages. \nNavigate to Settings → Things We Sell → Packages . \nSelect a package to pause, click the  More  (3-dots) menu, and select Pause for All Members . \nThe pop-up confirmation will show how many people are using the package.

Being featured means your business will be one of the first businesses shown in your area on the main Vagaro.com page, Vagaro apps, and our listings pages. This gives your business priority over the other businesses in your area because new customers will be able to find your business easier, giving you an edge with new clients over everyone else. \nGuidelines \n \n To ensure featured businesses are shown in the best possible light, we review all submissions for quality assurance. The Vagaro team will: make edits to images, select or upload a logo image that follows the Vagaro image standards, and complete the business profile and facility information if key information is missing. If there is no facility information or the business profile has not been filled out, the request to be featured will be denied. \nDo \nFill out all your business information. \nFill out all applicable facility information. \nSet your logo to a high-resolution photo or your business logo. \nChoose a photo that represents your business, such as a shot of your space, your work, a portrait of your team, etc. \nSet your logo on a 1920 x 1280px canvas. \nPhotograph your subject using natural, soft light that is not harsh. \nPhotograph your subject against a clean background. \nDon't \nDon't leave applicable information blank in your Business Profile or Facility Information. \nDon't use the logo image as a place for promotional information. You can use Daily Deals, or you can post the information in your Venue Gallery without setting it as your logo image. \nNo flash photography, please! Flash creates a bright spot on the subject, creating harsh light. \nNo distracting backgrounds. We want your work to be the focus. \nNo blurry or poor-resolution logo images. Your business is important to us, so we care how it looks to potential customers. Blurry photos are unprofessional. \nDo not use a collage. You have a small amount of space to entice customers, so choose one great visual that will invite them to your page. \nDon't put unnecessary information on your logo image. The only text on your logo image should be your business name. Your business information is on your Vagaro page, so there is no need to display it on your logo image. \nApproved Logo Image \nDenied Logo Image \nFor more tips on how to choose a great logo image, see Logo Image Tips . \nHow to access your Business Profile and Facility Information \n \n Click Settings , then from the  Business  section, click either Business Profile or Facility Information . \n",

In this article, we'll teach you how to create a SOAP note template and the process of designing and using modules for your custom SOAP note. This article also includes information on previewing, saving, and publishing a SOAP note, as well as additional information on using Vagaro Drive for file uploads. \nWhat's in this Article? \nPrerequisites \nCreate a SOAP Note Template \nAdd Your Own Chart \nSOAP Note Modules \nReview and Publish \nAdditional Information \nPrerequisites \n \n Forms Feature is Required \n Before following the steps below, activate the Forms feature . \n  Creating and managing SOAP note templates is only available on the web, tablet, and Pay Desk versions of Vagaro . \nCreate a SOAP Note Template \nFrom the  Calendar  screen, click the  Forms  tab at the top of the page. (Bottom of the screen for tablet and Pay Desk) \nIn the top-left corner, expand the  Create New  drop-down menu, and select  SOAP . \nClick Blank SOAP . \nNote \n You can also select and customize one of the SOAP templates. In this example, we will create a SOAP note from scratch. \nEnter a title for your SOAP note template. \nTo begin designing your SOAP note, drag a module from the side panel and drop it into the  Design  window. \nAdd Your Own Chart \n \n Customize and add your own charts for your SOAP note templates. If our current chart options don't fit your business's needs, you can easily attach your medical charts to your templates. For example, chiropractors can upload a spine chart to their template, easily mark up the image, and note where a patient is feeling pain on the spine. \nDrag and drop the  Image  module into the design window. \nDrag and drop your chart or image into the  Add Image  box or click Upload . \nOnce uploaded, drag the bottom-right corner of the chart to resize it. Click the pencil icon to remove the image. \nAdd a caption to your image. \nWhen filling out a SOAP note with the  Image  module, click the pencil icon in the top-right corner of the image to draw on and mark up your chart. \nOther Useful SOAP Note Modules \n \n  Character Limits : \nThe  Ask your question  field for each module has a 200-character limit. \nAnswers in the  Short Answer  module are limited to 2,000 characters. \nAnswers in the  Long Answer  module are limited to 10,000 characters. \nA  Heading  in the  Text  module is limited to 2,000 characters. \nA  Paragraph  in the  Text  module has no character limit because it is displayed as text. \nContact Information \nYou can use the  Contact Information  module to document your patient's information. You can also create or update customer profiles when the contact module is filled out. \nDrag and drop the  Contact Information  into the  Design  window. \nEnter a question. \nDeselect the checkboxes that you don't want to include in the SOAP note. \nYou can toggle Update or Save Customer to update the customer's profile or save them as a new customer. \nUpdate Existing Customer : Update the profile of a current customer when the  Contact Information  module is completed \nCreate New Customer : Add a new customer profile to your Vagaro account once the customer fills out the SOAP note. An email must be entered to create a new customer. \nDate and Time \nDrag and drop the  Date and Time  module into the Design window. \nExpand the  Date Options  drop-down menu and choose from the following options: \nDate \nTime \nDate and Time \nDate Range \nEnter a question. \nSignature \nAdd a signature to your SOAP note that can be signed by both a customer and an employee. \nDrag the  Signature  module into the  Design . window. \nSelect a  Customer  or  Employee  signee. \nWith  Employees  selected, you can choose specific employees or access levels that can sign the SOAP note. \nNote \n You can add as many  Signature  modules as needed. Your employees will receive a notification if they need to sign a SOAP note. To learn more about the unsigned form report, see here . \nFile Upload \nNote \n This module requires the Vagaro Drive feature. \n \n Require file uploads when filling out a SOAP note. You can also set how many files can be uploaded to the SOAP note. (maximum: 5) \nPreview and Publish \n \n  At the top of the  Design  window, you can preview your SOAP note before publishing it. Select the  Preview  or  Preview  tab to see how the SOAP note will look depending on the device used. Any changes you make when building your SOAP note will update the preview, so you can play around and fine-tune your SOAP note as needed. \n To save your new SOAP note, you can click  Save for Later  or  Publish . Saving for later will save your SOAP note as a draft that can be published later. When published, you can fill out and attach SOAP notes to a customer's profile. \nAdditional Information \nThis Feature Works Best With: \nIf you want to upload files to SOAP notes, you will need to activate Vagaro Drive. \n Use Vagaro Drive to add and store photos, files, and images and connect them to customer profiles, appointments, and forms. The Vagaro Drive Dashboard, in the web version, also gives you a place to store business files (leases, contracts, etc.) You can select from a range of data storage plans to fit your needs. \n  See the following articles for more information : \nActivate Vagaro Drive \nVagaro Drive Dashboard \nRelated Articles \nAttach SOAP Notes to a Customer's Profile - Web \nAttach SOAP Notes to a Customer's Profile - VPro \nControl Employee Access to SOAP Notes \nConvert Your Forms to SOAP Notes \n",
